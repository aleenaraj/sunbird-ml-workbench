constituents of air. As a result, the earth's surface
remains warm and thereby becomes suitable for the living world on the earth. If there
were no air on the earth, the average temperature of the earth's surface would have
been very low.
Transmission of sound
All the sounds that we hear reach us through the surrounding air. The density of
air also changes due to change in its temperature. In winter, the density of the air
increases. We can hear the whistle of a distant train clearly early in the morning in
winter. Air is useful as a medium for the transmission of sound.

What inference will you draw from the pictures
alongside ?
Water occurs in liquid state under ordinary
conditions. Water is a fluid substance. Water does not
have its own shape, but has a volume. It can pass
through small holes or seep through very small gaps
or cracks.
On pouring water in an oil-cladded dish, water
does not spread but forms small round drops. Why
does this happen?

Physical quantity
In day-to-day life, we measure many things such as the weight of fruits,
vegetables, food grains, temperature of the body or some liquids, volume of liquids,
density of various substances, the speed of vehicles, etc. Quantities such as mass,
weight, distance, speed, temperature, volume are called physical quantities.
A value and a unit are used to express the magnitude of a physical quantity.

Turbid water, ink, milk, buttermilk, blood are mixtures of liquids and insoluble
solids. When turbid water is kept undisturbed for a while, the soil particles in it
slowly settle to the bottom. The particles of milk or ink, however, do not settle
even on being left undisturbed. This is because the particles of the solids in such
mixtures, being very tiny and light, remain evenly distributed in the liquid. These
particles cannot be separated from the liquid even by methods like filtration or
settling.
How will you separate such solid
particles from the liquid ? In the laboratory,
a centrifuge machine is used to separate
solids from a mixture of a liquid and solid.
In consists of a disc, which rotates like a Electrical centrifuge
fan at great speed. There is a provision to
attach test tubes at the rim of this disc.
Manual
When the tubes attached to the disc
centrifuge
rotate at high speed, a force is generated
which pushes the particles away from the
centre. As a result, the solid particles in the
mixture in the test tubes collect at the
bottom of the tubes and are thereby
separated from the liquid.
Method of chromatography
14.6 Centrifuge
If two or more substances are dissolved in small proportions in the same solution,
these substances are separated from each other by means of chromatography. This
method is used in pharmaceutical science, factories and scientific laboratories for
detecting new ingredients and for identifying and separating components of a mixture.
