perform the iodine test again on its
leaves. Record your observations in your
notebook.
The leaves other than green also have
chlorophyll. The large amount of red,
brown and other pigments mask the
green colour (Fig. 1.4). Photosynthesis
takes place in these leaves also.
process of photosynthesis. The
carbohydrates are made of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen. These are used
to synthesise other components of food.
But proteins are nitrogenous substances
which contain nitrogen. From where do
the plants obtain nitrogen?
Recall that nitrogen is present in
abundance in gaseous form in the air.
However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen
in this form. Soil has certain bacteria
that convert gaseous nitrogen into a
usable form and release it into the soil.
These soluble forms are absorbed by the
plants along with water. Also, you might
have seen farmers adding fertilisers rich
in nitrogen to the soil. In this way the
plants fulfil their requirements of
nitrogen along with the other
constituents. Plants can then
synthesise components of food other
than carbohydrates such as proteins
and fats.
1.3 OTHER MODES OF NUTRITION IN
PLANTS
There are some plants which do not have
chlorophyll. They cannot synthesise
their food. How do they survive and from
where do they derive nutrition? Like
humans and animals such plants
depend on the food produced by other
plants. They use the heterotrophic
mode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do
you see yellow tubular structures
twining around the stem and branches
of a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta
(Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll.
It takes readymade food from the plant
Fig. 1.4 Leaves of various colours
You often see slimy, green patches
in ponds or in other stagnant water
bodies. These are generally formed by
the growth of organisms called algae.
Can you guess why algae are green in
colour? They contain chlorophyll which
gives them the green colour. Algae can
also prepare their own food by
photosynthesis.

The apex of the leaf forms a lid which
can open and close the mouth of the

which are directed downwards. When
an insect lands in the pitcher, the lid
closes and the trapped insect gets
entangled into the hair. The insect is
digested by the digestive juices secreted
in the pitcher. Such insect-eating plants
are called insectivorous plants.
Is it possible that such plants do not
get all the required nutrients from the
soil in which they grow?

1.4 SAPROTROPHS
You might have seen packets of
mushrooms sold in the vegetable
market. You may have also seen fluffy
umbrella-like patches growing on rotting
wood during the rainy season (Fig. 1.7).
Let us find out what type of nutrients
they need to survive and from where
they get them.
Fig. 1.8 Fungi
growing on bread
Fig. 1.7 Packet of mushrooms, a mushroom
growing on decayed material
Write down your observations in your
notebook. Most probably you will see
cotton-like threads spread on the piece
of bread.
These organisms are called fungi.
They have a different mode of nutrition.
They secrete digestive juices on the dead
and decaying matter and convert it into
a solution. Then they absorb the
nutrients from it. This mode of nutrition
in which organisms take in nutrients in
solution form from dead and decaying
matter is called saprotrophic nutrition.
Plants which use saprotrophic mode of
nutrition are called saprotrophs.
Fungi also grow on pickles, leather,
clothes and other articles that are left
in hot and humid weather for long time.
Boojho wants to know how
these organisms acquire
nutrients. They do not have
mouths like animals do. They are
not like green plants as they lack
chlorophyll and cannot make food
l by photosynthesis.
Activity 1.2
Take a piece of bread and moisten it with
water. Leave it in a moist warm place
for 2-3 days or until fluffy patches
appear on them (Fig. 1.8). These patches
may be white, green, brown or of any
other colour. Observe the patches under
a microscope or a magnifying glass.
Paheli is keen to know
whether her beautiful shoes,
which she wore on special
occasions, were spoiled by fungi
during the rainy season. She
wants to know how fungi appear
suddenly during the rainy
season.
SCIENCE
s Boojho says once his
grandfather told him that his
wheat fields were spoiled by a
fungus. He wants to know if
fungi cause diseases also.
Paheli told him that many fungi <
like yeast and mushrooms are
useful, but some fungi
cause diseases in plants,
animals and humans.
Some fungi are also used
in medicines.
During the rainy season they spoil many
things. Ask your parents about the
menace of fungi in your house.
The fungal spores are generally
present in the air. When they land on
wet and warm things they germinate
and grow. Now, can you figure out how
we can protect our things from getting
spoiled?
Some organisms live together and
share shelter and nutrients. This is
called symbiotic relationship. For
example, certain fungi live in the roots
of trees. The tree provides nutrients to
the fungus and, in return, receives help
from it to take up water and nutrients
from the soil. This association is very
important for the tree.
In organisms called lichens, a
chlorophyll-containing partner, which is
an alga, and a fungus live together. The
fungus provides shelter, water and
minerals to the alga and, in return, the
alga provides food which it prepares by
photosynthesis.
1.5 How NUTRIENTS ARE
REPLENISHED IN THE SOIL
Have you seen farmers spreading
manure or fertilisers in the fields, or
gardeners using them in lawns or in
pots? Do you know why they are added
to the soil?
You learnt that plants absorb
mineral nutrients from the soil. So, their
amounts in the soil keep on declining.
Fertilisers and manures contain plant
nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium,
phosphorous, etc. These nutrients need
to be added from time to time to enrich
the soil. We can grow plants and keep
them healthy if we can find out the
nutrient requirement of plants.
Usually crops require a lot of nitrogen
to make proteins. After the harvest, the
soil becomes deficient in nitrogen.
Though nitrogen gas is available in
plenty in the air, plants cannot use it in
the manner they can use carbon dioxide.
They need nitrogen in a soluble form.
The bacterium called Rhizobium can
take atmospheric nitrogen and convert
it into a soluble form. But Rhizobium
cannot make its own food. So it lives in
the roots of gram, peas, moong beans
and other legumes and provides them
with nitrogen. Most of the pulses (dals)
are obtained from leguminous plants.
In return, the plants provide food and
shelter to the bacteria. They have a
NUTRITION IN PLANTS
7
symbiotic relationship. This association
is of great significance for the farmers.
They do not need to add nitrogen
fertiliser to the soil in which leguminous
plants are grown.
In this chapter you learnt that
most of the plants are autotrophs.
Only a few plants adopt other modes
of nutrition like parasitic and
saprotrophic. They derive nutrition
from other organisms. All animals
are categorised as heterotrophs since
they depend on plants and other
animals for food. Can we say that
the insectivorous plants are partial
heterotrophs?

What you have learnt
All organisms take food and utilise it to get energy for the growth and
maintenance of their bodies.
Green plants synthesise their food themselves by the process of
photosynthesis. They are autotrophs.
Plants use simple chemical substances like carbon dioxide, water and
minerals for the synthesis of food.
Chlorophyll and sunlight are the essential requirements for
photosynthesis.
Complex chemical substances such as carbohydrates are the products
of photosynthesis.
Solar energy is stored by the leaves with the help of chlorophyll.
Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis.
Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by other living organisms
for their survival.
Fungi derive nutrition from dead, decaying matter. They are saprotrophs.
Plants like cuscuta are parasites. They take food from the host plant.
A few plants and all animals are dependent on others for their nutrition
and are called heterotrophs.

Nutrition in Animals
You have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot. Animals get their
food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants. Some animals
eat both plants and animals. Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth, repair and functioning
of the body. Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement, mode of intake
of food and its utilisation in the body.
You have studied in Class VI that food
consists of many components. Try to
recall and list them below:
food into simpler substances is called
digestion.
2.1 DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD
The mode of taking food into the body
varies in different organisms. Bees and
humming-birds suck the nectar of
plants, infants of human and many
other animals feed on mother's milk.
Snakes like the python swallow the
animals they prey upon. Some aquatic
animals filter tiny food particles floating
nearby and feed upon them.

2.2 DIGESTION IN HUMANS
We take in food through the mouth,
digest and utilise it. The unused parts
of the food are defecated. Have you ever
wondered what happens to the food
inside the body? The food passes
through a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)
which begins at the buccal cavity and
ends at the anus. The canal can be
divided into various compartments:
(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or
oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small
intestine, (5) large intestine ending in
the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a
very long path? These parts together
form the alimentary canal (digestive
tract). The food components gradually
get digested as food travels through the
various compartments. The inner walls

tract and the associated glands together
constitute the digestive system.

Sweets and tooth decay
Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria
break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids (see Chapter 5 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually
damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not m
treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, cold drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay.
Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or dantun (C)
and dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between
two teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and
rinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

SCIENCE
Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may get
hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the
windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of
swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel
choked or get hiccups.

and the chest. Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe.
Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards (Fig. 2.7).
At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out. Recall the
instances when you vomited after eating
and think of the reason for it. Discuss
with your parents and teacher.
The stomach
The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its
shape is like a flattened U and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal. It
receives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other.
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices. The mucous protects
the lining of the stomach. The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with the
food and makes the medium in the
stomach acidic. The digestive juices
break down the proteins into simpler
substances.
The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 7.5 metres long. It receives
secretions from the liver and the
pancreas. Besides, its wall also secretes
juices.
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of the
abdomen on the right side. It is the
largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats.
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below the
stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice
acts on carbohydrates and proteins and
changes them into simpler forms. The
The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole
in his stomach. He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properly
(Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as a great opportunity
to see the inside of the stomach through the hole.
He made some wonderful observations.
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning
food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest Fig. 2.8 Alexis St. Martin's
shotgun wound
the food. He also observed that the end of the
stomach opens into the intestine only after the digestion of the food inside the
stomach is completed.
16
SCIENCE
partly digested food now reaches the
lower part of the small intestine where
the intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food.
The carbohydrates get broken into
simple sugars such as glucose, fats into
fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins
into amino acids.
Absorption in the small
intestine
The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.
This process is called absorption. The
inner walls of the small intestine have
thousands of finger-like outgrowths.
These are called villi (singular villus).
Can you guess what the role of villi could
be in the intestine? The villi increase
the surface area for absorption of the
digested food. Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close to
its surface. The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials. The
absorbed substances are transported
via the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as the
proteins required by the body. This is
called assimilation. In the cells, glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen into
carbon dioxide and water, and energy
is released. The food that remains
undigested and unabsorbed then enters
into the large intestine.
Large intestine
The large intestine is wider and shorter
than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
in length. Its function is to absorb water
and some salts from the undigested food
material. The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there as
semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
time-to-time. This is called egestion.

2.3 DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING
ANIMALS
Have you observed cows, buffaloes and
other grass-eating animals chewing
continuously even when they are not
eating grass? Actually, they quickly
swallow the grass and store it in a
separate part of the stomach called
rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets
Diarrhoea
Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.
This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food
poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.
Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water
with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration
Solution (ORS).

Ruminants have a large sac-like
structure between the small intestine
and large intestine (Fig. 2.9). The
cellulose of the food is digested here by
the action of certain bacteria which are
not present in humans.
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system. But
there are many small organisms which
do not have a mouth and a digestive
system. Then, how do they acquire and
digest food? In the section below you will
learn another interesting way of food
intake.
2.4 FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN
AMOEBA
Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled
organism found in pond water. Amoeba
has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense
nucleus and many small bubble-like
vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.
Amoeba constantly changes its shape
and position. It pushes out one, or
more finger-like projections, called
pseudopodia or false feet for movement
and capture of food.
Amoeba feeds on some microscopic
organisms. When it senses food, it
partially digested and is called cud. But
later the cud returns to the mouth in
small lumps and the animal chews it.
This process is called rumination and
these animals are called ruminants.
The grass is rich in cellulose, a type
of carbohydrate. Many animals,
including humans, cannot digest
cellulose.

pushes out pseudopodia around the
food particle and engulfs it. The food
becomes trapped in a food vacuole
[Fig. 2.10).
Digestive juices are secreted into the
food vacuole. They act on the food and
break it down into simpler substances
Gradually the digested food is absorbed.
The absorbed substances are used for
growth, maintenance and multiplication.
The undigested residue of the food is
expelled outside by the vacuole.
The basic process of digestion of
food and release of energy is the same
in all animals. In a later chapter you
will learn about the transport of food
absorbed by the intestine to the various
parts of the body.

What you have learnt
Animal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food
and its utilisation in the body.
The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and
secretory glands. It consists of the (i) buccal cavity, (ii) oesophagus,
(iii) stomach, (iv) small intestine, (v) large intestine ending in rectum
and (vi) anus. The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juices
are (i) the salivary glands, (ii) the liver and (iii) the pancreas. The stomach
wall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices.
The modes of feeding vary in different organisms.
Digestion is a complex process involving: (i) ingestion, (ii) digestion,
(iii) absorption, (iv) assimilation and (v) egestion.
NUTRITION IN ANIMALS
19
Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The
digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from the
liver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juice from
the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of food in
the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vessels in
the small intestine.
The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body.
Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in the
large intestine.
The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the body
as faeces through the anus.
The grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known as
ruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it in
the rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews
it peacefully.
Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia.
The food is digested in the food vacuole.

Fibre to Fabric
n Class VI you have learnt about
some fibres obtained from plants.
You also learnt that wool and silk
fibres are obtained from animals. Wool
is obtained from the fleece (hair) of
sheep or yak. Silk fibres come from
Cocoons of the silk moth. Do you know
which part of the sheep's body yields
fibres? Are you aware how these fibres
are converted into the woollen yarn that
we buy from the market to knit sweaters?
Do you have any idea how silk fibres are
made into silk, which is woven into saris?
In this Chapter we shall try to find
answers to these questions.
Animal fibres – wool and silk
Like us, the hairy skin of the sheep
has two types of fibres that form its
fleece: (i) the coarse beard hair, and
(ii) the fine soft under-hair close to the
skin. The fine hair provide the fibres for
making wool. Some breeds of sheep
possess only fine under-hair. Their
parents are specially chosen to give birth
to sheep which have only soft under-
hair. This process of selecting parents
for obtaining special characters in their
offspring, such as soft under hair in
sheep, is termed 'selective breeding'.
3.1 WOOL
Wool comes from sheep, goat, yak and
some other animals. These wool-yielding
animals bear hair on their body. Do you
know why these animals have a thick
coat of hair? Hair trap a lot of air. Air is
a poor conductor of heat, as you would
learn in Chapter 4. So, hair keeps these
animals warm. Wool is derived from
these hairy fibres.

goat is soft. It is woven into fine shawls
called Pashmina shawls.
The fur (hair) on the body of camels

From fibres to wool
For obtaining wool, sheep are reared.
Their hair is cut and processed into
wool. Let us learn about this process.
Rearing and breeding of sheep: If you
travel to the hills in Jammu & Kashmir,
Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal,
Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, or the
plains of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan
and Gujarat, you can see shepherds
taking their herds of sheep for grazing.
Sheep are herbivores and prefer grass
and leaves. Apart from grazing sheep,
rearers also feed them on a mixture of
pulses, corn, jowar, oil cakes (material
left after taking out oil from seeds) and
minerals. In winter, sheep are kept
indoors and fed on leaves, grain and dry
fodder.
Sheep are reared in many parts of
our country for wool. Table 3.1 gives the
names of some breeds of sheep reared
in our country for producing wool. The
quality and texture of the fibres obtained
from them is also indicated in the table.
Certain breeds of sheep have thick
coat of hair on their body which yields
good quality wool in large quantities. As
mentioned earlier, these sheep are
""selectively bred” with one parent being
a sheep of good breed.
Once the reared sheep have
developed a thick growth of hair, hair is
shaved off for getting wool.
Processing fibres into wool
The wool which is used for knitting
sweaters or for weaving shawls is the
finished product of a long process,
which involves the following steps:
Step I: The fleece of the sheep along with a
thin layer of skin is removed from its
body (Fig. 3.8 (a)]. This process is called
shearing. Machines similar to those used
by barbers are used to shave off hair.
Usually, hair are removed during the hot
weather. This enables sheep to survive
without their protective coat of hair. The
hair provide woollen fibres. Woollen
fibres are then processed to obtain
woollen yarn. Shearing does not hurt
the sheep just as it does not hurt when
you get a hair cut or your father shaves his
beard. Do you know why? The uppermost
layer of the skin is dead. Also, the hair of
sheep grow again just as your hair does.

Step II: The sheared skin with hair is
thoroughly washed in tanks to remove
grease, dust and dirt. This is called
scouring. Nowadays scouring is done
by machines (Fig. 3.8 (b) and (c)].
Step III: After scouring, sorting is done.
The hairy skin is sent to a factory where
hair of different textures are separated
or sorted.
Step IV: The small fluffy fibres, called
burrs, are picked out from the hair.
These are the same burrs which
sometimes appear on your sweaters. The
fibres are scoured again and dried. This
is the wool ready to be drawn into fibres.
s
Step V: The fibres can be dyed in various
colours, as the natural fleece of sheep
and goats is black, brown or white.
Step VI: The fibres are straightened,
combed and rolled into yarn
[Fig. 3.8 (d)]. The longer fibres are
made into wool for sweaters and the
shorter fibres are spun and woven
into woollen cloth.

Life history of silk moth

which hatch larvae which are called
caterpillars or silkworms. They grow in
size and when the caterpillar is ready to
enter the next stage of its life history
called pupa, it first weaves a net to hold
itself. Then it swings its head from side
to side in the form of the figure of eight (8).

From cocoon to silk
For obtaining silk, moths are reared
and their cocoons are collected to get
silk threads.
Rearing silkworms: A female silk moth
lays hundreds of eggs at a time
[Fig. 3.10 (a)]. The eggs are stored
carefully on strips of cloth or paper and
sold to silkworm farmers. The farmers
keep eggs under hygienic conditions
and under suitable conditions of
temperature and humidity.
The eggs are warmed to a suitable
temperature for the larvae to hatch from
eggs. This is done when mulberry trees
[Fig. 3.10 (b)] bear a fresh crop of leaves.
The larvae, called caterpillars or
silkworms, eat day and night and
increase enormously in size [Fig. 3.10 (c)].

Discovery of silk
The exact time of discovery of silk is perhaps unknown. According to an old
Chinese legend, the empress Si-lung-Chi was asked by the emperor Huang-ti to
find the cause of the damaged leaves of mulberry trees growing in their garden.
The empress found white worms eating up mulberry leaves. She also noticed
that they were spinning shiny cocoons around them. Accidentally a cocoon
dropped into her cup of tea and a tangle of delicate threads separated from the
cocoon. Silk industry began in China and was kept a closely guarded secret for
hundreds of years. Later on, traders and travellers introduced silk to other
countries. The route they travelled is still called the ‘silk route'.
30
SCIENCE
Paheli wants to know if the
cotton thread and silk thread
are spun and woven in the
same manner.
The worms are kept in clean bamboo
trays along with freshly chopped
mulberry leaves. After 25 to 30 days,
the caterpillars stop eating and
move to a tiny chamber of bamboo in
the tray to spin cocoons (Fig. 3.10 (d)).
Small racks or twigs may be provided
in the trays to which cocoons get
attached. The caterpillar or silkworm
spins the cocoon inside which develops
the silk moth.
Processing silk: A pile of cocoons is
used for obtaining silk fibres. The
cocoons are kept under the sun or boiled
or exposed to steam. The silk fibres
separate out. The process of taking out
threads from the cocoon for use as silk
is called reeling the silk. Reeling is done
in special machines, which unwind
the threads or fibres of silk from the
cocoon. Silk fibres are then spun into
silk threads, which are woven into silk
cloth by weavers.

What you have learnt
Silk comes from silkworms and wool from sheep, goat and yak. Hence
silk and wool are animal fibres.
The hairs of camel, llama and alpaca are also processed to yield wool.
In India, mostly sheep are reared for getting wool.
Sheep hair is sheared off from the body, scoured, sorted, dried, dyed,
spun and woven to yield wool.
Silkworms are caterpillars of silk moth.
During their life cycle, the worms spin cocoons of silk fibres.
Silk fibres are made of a protein.
Silk fibres from cocoons are taken out and reeled into silk threads.
Weavers weave silk threads into silk cloth.

The temperature of every person may
not be 37°C. It could be slightly higher
or slightly lower. Actually, what we call
normal temperature is the average body
temperature of a large number of healthy
persons.
The clinical thermometer is designed
to measure the temperature of human
body only. The temperature of human

case of the clinical thermometer,
find out how much a small
division on this thermometer
reads. You would need this
information to read the
thermometer correctly.
Let us now learn how this
thermometer is used.
Boojho got a naughty idea. He
wanted to measure the temperature
of hot milk using a clinical
thermometer. Paheli stopped him
from doing so.
CAUTION
Activity 4.4
Do not use a clinical thermometer for
measuring the temperature of any
object other than the human body.
Also avoid keeping the thermometer in
the sun or near a flame. It may break.
Take some tap water in a beaker
or a mug. Dip the thermometer
in water so that the bulb is
immersed in water but does not
touch the bottom or the sides of
the container. Hold the
thermometer vertically (Fig. 4.5).
Observe the movement of mercury
in the thermometer. Wait till the
mercury thread becomes steady.
4.3 LABORATORY THERMOMETER

other objects? For this purpose, there
are other thermometers. One such
thermometer is known as the laboratory

Are there any variations in the
readings? Discuss the possible reasons.
Let us try to answer this question.
Activity 4.5
Take some hot water in a beaker or a
mug. Dip the thermometer in water.
Wait till the mercury thread becomes
steady and note the temperature. Now
take out the thermometer from water.
Observe carefully what happens now.
Do you notice that as soon as you take
the thermometer out of water, the level
of mercury begins to fall. This means
that the temperature must be read while
the thermometer is in water.
You may recall that while taking your
own temperature, you have to take the
thermometer out of your mouth to note
the reading. Can you then use the
laboratory thermometer to measure your

Boojho now understand why
clinical thermometer cannot be
used to measure high
temperatures. But still wonders
whether a laboratory thermometer
can be used to measure his body
temperature.
Boojho wonders why the level
of mercury should change at
all when the bulb of the

convenient to use the laboratory
thermometer for this purpose.
Why does the mercury not fall or rise
in a clinical thermometer when taken
out of the mouth?
Observe a clinical thermometer
again. Do you see a kink near the bulb
(Fig. 4.6).
What is the use of the kink? It
prevents mercury level from falling on
its own.

object to a colder object.
How does heat flow? Let us
investigate.
Activity 4.6
Take a rod or flat strip of a metal, say of
aluminium or iron. Fix a few small wax
pieces on the rod. These pieces should
be at nearly equal distances (Fig. 4.7).
Clamp the rod to a stand. If you do not
find a stand, you can put one end of
the rod in between bricks. Now, heat
the other end of the rod and observe.
What happens to the wax pieces? Do
these pieces begin to fall? Which piece

There is a lot of concern over
the use of mercury in
thermometers. Mercury is a
toxic substance and is very
difficult to dispose of if a
thermometer breaks. These

4.4 TRANSFER OF HEAT
You might have observed that a frying
pan becomes hot when kept on a flame.
It is because the heat passes from the
flame to the utensil. When the pan is
removed from the fire, it slowly cools
down. Why does it cool down? The heat
is transferred from the pan to the
surroundings. So you can understand
that in both cases, the heat flows from
a hotter object to a colder object. In fact,
transferred from the end nearest to the
flame to the other end?

This process continues till the whole

transfer is known as convection.
How does the heat travel in air? In
which direction does the smoke go?
The air near the heat source gets hot
and rises. The air from the sides comes
in to take its place. In this way the air
gets heated. The following activity
confirms this idea.
Activity 4.9
Light a candle. Keep one hand above the
flame and one hand on the side of the
flame (Fig. 4.10). Do your hands feel
equally hot? If not which hand feels
hotter? And why?
Notice that towards the top, the air
gets heated by convection. Therefore, the
hand above the flame feels hot. On the
sides, however, there is no convection
and air does not feel as hot as at
the top.
The people living in the coastal areas
experience an interesting phenomenon.
During the day, the land gets heated
faster than the water. The air over the
land becomes hotter and rises up. The
cooler air from the sea rushes in towards
the land to take its place. The warm air
from the land moves towards the sea to
complete the cycle. The air from the sea
is called the sea breeze. To receive the
cooler sea breeze, the windows of the
houses in coastal areas are made to face
the sea. At night it is exactly the reverse
(Fig. 4.11). The water cools down more
slowly than the land. So, the cool air
from the land moves towards the sea.
This is called the land breeze. Fig. 4.11
shows this phenomenon.
When we come out in the sun, we
feel warm. How does the heat from the
sun reach us? It cannot reach us by
conduction or convection as there is no
medium such as air in most part of the

SCIENCE
What you have learnt
Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness
of an object.
Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.
Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperatures.
Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature. The
range of this thermometer is from 35°C to 42°С. For other purposes, we
use the laboratory thermometers. The range of these thermometers is
usually from -10°C to 110°C.
The normal temperature of the human body is 37°C.
The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower
temperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from one
object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.
In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids
and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required
for transfer of heat by radiation.
The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are
conductors of heat.
The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are
called insulators.
Dark-coloured objects absorb radiation better than the light-coloured
objects. That is the reason we feel more comfortable in light-coloured
clothes in the summer.
Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is a
poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres.

Acids, Bases and Salts
e use in our daily life a large
number of substances such
as lemon, tamarind, common
salt, sugar and vinegar. Do they have
the same taste? Let us recall tastes of
some edible substances listed in
Table 5.1. If you have not tasted any of
these substances taste it now and enter
the result in Table 5.1.
CAUTION
1. Do not taste anything unless asked
to do so.
2. Do not touch anything unless asked

You find that some of these
substances taste sour, some taste bitter,
some taste sweet and some taste salty.
5.1 ACIDS AND BASES
Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and
vinegar taste sour. These substances
taste sour because they contain acids.
The chemical nature of such
substances is acidic. The word acid
comes from the Latin word acere which
means sour. The acids in these
substances are natural acids.
What about baking soda? Does it also
taste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since,
it does not taste sour it means, that it
has no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If
you rub its solution between fingers, it
feels soapy. Substances like these which
are bitter in taste and feel soapy on
touching are known as bases. The nature
of such substances is said to be basic.
If we cannot taste every substance,
how do we find its nature?
Special type of substances are used
to test whether a substance is acidic or
basic. These substances are known as
indicators. The indicators change their
colour when added to a solution
containing an acidic or a basic
substance. Turmeric, litmus, china rose
petals (Gudhal), etc., are some of the
naturally occurring indicators.

Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damaging
effect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is
called an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic
because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released
into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric
acid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,
historical monuments, plants and animals.

Add to the acidic solution a drop of
sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.
Stir the tube gently. Is there any change
in the colour of the solution? Continue
adding the sodium hydroxide solution
drop by drop while stirring till the pink
colour just appears.
Now add one more drop of dilute
hydrochloric acid. What do you observe?
The solution again becomes colourless.
Again add one drop of sodium
hydroxide solution. Is there any change
in colour? The solution again becomes
pink in colour.
It is evident that when the solution
is basic, phenolphthalein gives a pink
colour. On the other hand, when the
solution is acidic, it remains colourless.

SCIENCE
When an acidic solution is mixed
with a basic solution, both the solutions
neutralise the effect of each other. When
an acid solution and a base solution are
mixed in suitable amounts, both the
acidic nature of the acid and the basic
nature of the base are destroyed. The
resulting solution is neither acidic nor
basic. Touch the test tube immediately
after neutralisation. What do you
observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat
is always produced, or evolved. The
evolved heat raises the temperature of
the reaction mixture.
In neutralisation reaction a new
substance is formed. This is called salt.
Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral in
nature. Thus, neutralisation can be
defined as follows:
The reaction between an acid and
Salt+Water
a base is known as neutralisation. Salt
and water are produced in this process
with the evolution of heat.
Acid+Base Salt+Water
(Heat is evolved)
The following reaction is an example:

LIFE

much of acid in the stomach causes
indigestion. Sometimes indigestion
is painful. To relieve indigestion, we
take an antacid such as milk of
magnesia, which contains magnesium
hydroxide. It neutralises the effect of
excessive acid.
Ant sting
The sting of an ant contains formic
acid. When an ant bites, it injects
the acidic liquid into the skin. The
effect of the sting can be neutralised by
rubbing moist baking soda (sodium
hydrogen carbonate) or calamine
solution, which contains zinc
carbonate.
Soil treatment
Excessive use of chemical fertilisers
makes the soil acidic. Plants do not grow
well when the soil is either too acidic or
too basic. When the soil is too acidic, it
is treated with bases like quick lime
(calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium
hydroxide). If the soil is basic, organic
matter is added to it. Organic matter
releases acids which neutralises the
basic nature of the soil.
Factory wastes
The wastes of many factories
contain acids. If they are allowed to
flow into the water bodies, the acids
will kill fish and other organisms.
The factory wastes are, therefore,
neutralised by adding basic
substances.

acid. It helps us to digest food, as you

What you have learnt
Acids are sour in taste. Bases are bitter in taste and soapy to touch.
Acid turns blue litmus red. Bases turn red litmus blue.
Substances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral.
Solutions of substances that show different colour in acidic, basic and
neutral solutions are called indicators.
An acid and a base neutralise each other and form a salt. A salt may be
acidic, basic or neutral in nature.

Each cell in our body contains an acid, the deoxyribonucleic acid or
DNA. It controls every feature of the body such as our looks, colour of
our eyes, our height etc. Proteins that build part of our cells are also

Physical and Chemical
Changes
A very day you come across many
changes in your surroundings.
These changes may involve one
or more substances. For example, your
mother may ask you to dissolve sugar
in water to make a cold drink. Making a
sugar solution is a change. Similarly,
setting curd from milk is a change.
Sometimes milk becomes sour. Souring
of milk is a change. Stretched rubber
band also represents a change.
Make a list of ten changes you have
noticed around you.
In this chapter we shall perform some
activities and study the nature of these
changes. Broadly, these changes are of
two kinds, physical and chemical.
6.1 PHYSICAL CHANGES
Activity 6.1
Cut a piece of paper in four square
pieces. Cut each square piece further
into four square pieces. Lay these pieces
on the floor or a table so that the pieces
acquire the shape of the original piece
of paper (Fig. 6.1).
Obviously, you cannot join the pieces
back to make the original piece, but is
there a change in the property of the
paper?
Activity 6.2
Collect the chalk dust lying on the floor
near the blackboard in your classroom.
Or, crush a small piece of chalk into
dust. Add a little water to the dust to
make a paste. Roll it into the shape of a
piece of chalk. Let it dry.
Did you recover chalk from the
dust?
Activity 6.3
Take some ice in a glass or plastic
tumbler. Melt a small portion of ice by
placing the tumbler in the sun. You have
now a mixture of ice and water. Now
place the tumbler in a freezing mixture
(ice plus common salt).
Does the water become solid ice once
again?
Fig. 6.1 Paper pieces
Activity 6.4
Boil some water in a container. Do you
see the steam rising from the surface of
water? Hold an inverted pan by its
handle over the steam at some distance
from the boiling water. Observe the
inner surface of the pan.
Do you see any droplet of water
there?
Activity 6.5
CAUTION
Be careful while handling a flame.
Hold a used hack-saw blade with a
pair of tongs. Keep the tip of the free
end on the flame of a gas stove. Wait for
a few minutes.
Does the colour of the tip of the blade
change?
Remove the blade from the flame.
Observe the tip once again after some
time.
Does it get back its original colour?
In Activities 6.1 and 6.2 above, you
saw that paper and a piece of chalk
underwent changes in size. In Activities
6.3 and 6.4, water changed its state (from
solid to liquid, or from gas to liquid). In
Activity 6.5, the hack-saw blade
changed colour on heating.
Properties such as shape, size, colour
and state of a substance are called its
physical properties. A change in which
a substance undergoes a change in its
physical properties is called a physical
change. A physical change is generally
reversible. In such a change no new
substance is formed.
Let us now consider the other kind
of change.
6.2 CHEMICAL CHANGE
A change with which you are quite
familiar is the rusting of iron. If you
leave a piece of iron in the open for some
time, it acquires a film of brownish
substance. This substance is called rust
and the process is called rusting
(Fig. 6.2). Iron gates of parks or
farmlands, iron benches kept in lawns
and gardens, almost every article of iron,
kept in the open gets rusted. At home
you must have seen shovels and spades
getting rusted when exposed to the

atmosphere for some time. In the
kitchen, a wet iron pan (tawa) often gets
rusted if left in that state for some time.
Rust is not iron. It is different from iron
on which it gets deposited.
Let us consider a few more changes
where new substances are formed.

It is dangerous to look for long at the
burning magnesium ribbon. The
teachers should advise children not
to stare at the burning ribbon.
light (Fig. 6.3). When it is completely
burnt it leaves behind a powdery ash.
Does the ash look like the
magnesium ribbon?
The change can be represented by
the following equation:
Magnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (0) ►
Magnesium oxide (Mgo)
The equations here are different from
those in mathematics. In equations
of this kind, the arrow implies
'becomes’. No attempt should be made
to balance chemical equations at this
stage.

ribbon of magnesium. Clean its tip with
sandpaper. Bring the tip near a candle

(aqueous solution) well. Test the mixture
with blue and red litmus papers.
Does the mixture turn red litmus
blue?
Does the mixture turn blue litmus
red?
On the basis of this test, how do you
classify the aqueous solution — acidic
or basic?
On dissolving the ash in water it
forms a new substance. This change can
be written in the form of the following
equation:
Magnesium oxide (MgO) + Water
(H,O) → Magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)]
As you have already learnt in
Chapter 5, magnesium hydroxide is a base.
So, magnesium oxide is a new substance
formed on burning of magnesium.
Magnesium hydroxide is another new

substance formed by mixing magnesium
oxide with water.
Activity 6.7
(To be demonstrated by the teacher)
Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper
sulphate (blue vitriol or neela thotha) in
about half a cup of water in a glass
tumbler or a beaker. Add a few drops of
dilute sulphuric acid to the solution.
You should get a blue coloured solution.
Save a small sample of the solution in a
test tube or a small glass bottle. Drop a
nail or a used shaving blade into the
remaining solution. Wait for half an
hour or so. Observe the colour of the
solution. Compare it with the colour of
the sample solution saved separately
(Fig. 6.4).
colour of the solution from blue to
green is due to the formation of iron
sulphate, a new substance. The brown
deposit on the iron nail is copper,
another new substance. We can write
the reaction as:
Copper Sulphate solution (blue) + Iron
→ Iron Sulphate solution (green)
+ Copper (brown deposit)
Activity 6.8
Take about a teaspoonful of vinegar in
a test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda
to it. You would hear a hissing sound
and see bubbles of a gas coming out.
Pass this gas through freshly prepared
lime water as shown in Fig. 6.5.

The changes that you notice are
due to a reaction between copper
sulphate and iron. The change of
The change in the test tube is as
follows:
Vinegar (Acetic acid) + Baking soda

Fig. 6.5 Set up to pass gas through lime water
Carbon dioxide (CO,) + Lime water
[Ca(OH),] → Calcium Carbonate
(CaCO3) + Water (HO)
When carbon dioxide is passed
through lime water, calcium carbonate
is formed, which makes lime water milky.
The turning of lime water into milky is a
standard test of carbon dioxide. You will
use it in Chapter 10 to show that the air
we breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide.
In Activities 6.6-6.8, you saw that
in each change one or more new
substances were formed. In Activity 6.6,
the ash was the new substance formed
when magnesium was burnt. In Activity 6.7,
the reaction of copper sulphate with iron
produced iron sulphate and copper.
Both of these are new substances.
Copper was deposited on the shaving
blade of iron. In Activity 6.8, vinegar and
baking soda together produced carbon
dioxide, which turned lime water milky.
Can you name the new substance
formed in this reaction?
A change in which one or more
new substances are formed is called a
chemical change. A chemical change
is also called a chemical reaction.
Chemical changes are very important
in our lives. All new substances are
formed as a result of chemical changes.
For example, if a metal is to be extracted
from an ore, such as iron from iron ore,
we need to carry out a series of chemical
changes. A medicine is the end product
of a chain of chemical reactions. Useful
new materials, such as plastics and
detergents, are produced by chemical
reactions. Indeed, every new material
is discovered by studying chemical
changes.
We have seen that one or more new
substances are produce in a chemical
change. In addition to new products,
the following may accompany a chemical
change:
Heat, light or any other radiation
(ultraviolet, for example) may be given
off or absorbed.
Sound may be produced.
A change in smell may take place or
a new smell may be given off.
• A colour change may take place .
• A gas may be formed.
Let us look at some examples.
You saw that burning of magnesium
ribbon is a chemical change. Burning
of coal, wood or leaves is also a chemical
change. In fact, burning of any
substance is a chemical change.
Burning is always accompanied by
production of heat.

o you remember the things that
you were asked to pack when
you were heading for a hill
station? When the sky is cloudy, your
parents insist that you carry an
umbrella. Have you heard elders in your
family discuss the weather before
planning a family function? You must
have also heard the experts discussing
the weather before the start of a game.
Have you ever wondered why? The
weather may have a profound effect on
the game. It has a profound effect on
our lives. Many of our daily activities are
planned based on the weather predicted
for that day. There are daily reports of
the weather on the television and
radio and in the newspapers. But do you
know what this weather really is?
In this chapter, we will study about
the weather and climate. We will also
see how different forms of life are
adapted to the climate of their habitat.
7.1 WEATHER
In Fig. 7.1 a sample of weather report
from a newspaper is given.
We find that the daily weather report
carries information about the
temperature, humidity and rainfall
during the past 24 hours. It also
predicts the weather for the day.
Humidity, as you might know, is a
measure of the moisture in air.
| The weather reports are prepared by
the Meteorological Department of the
Government. This department collects
data on temperature, wind, etc., and
makes the weather prediction.
Activity 7.1
Cut out the weather reports of the last
week from any newspaper. If you do not
get a newspaper at home borrow from
your neighbours or friends and copy
these reports in your notebook. You can
also collect weather reports from a
library. Paste all the cut-outs on a white
sheet or on a chart paper.
Now record the information from the
weather reports collected by you in
Table 7.1. The first row is just a sample.

in the chart that you have prepared.

*(Rainfall may not be recorded for all the days since it may not rain everyday. Leave

Rainfall is measured by an
instrument called the rain gauge. It
is basically a measuring cylinder with
a funnel on top to collect rainwater
Do all the seven days have the same
maximum and minimum temperatures,
humidity and rainfall? The maximum
and minimum temperatures recorded
may be the same for some of the days.
However, all the parameters are not the
same on any two days. Over a week there
may be considerable variation. The day-
to-day condition of the atmosphere
at a place with respect to the
temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-
speed, etc., is called the weather at that
place. The temperature, humidity, and
other factors are called the elements of
the weather. The weather of a place
changes day after day and week after
week. That is why we often say, “today's
weather is too humid"", or ""the weather
was warm last week”.
The weather is such a complex
phenomenon that it can vary over very
short periods of time. It can happen
sometimes that it is sunny in the
morning, but suddenly clouds appear
from nowhere and it starts raining
heavily. Or, a heavy rain may vanish in
a matter of minutes and give way to
bright sunshine. You must have had
several such experiences. Try to recall
any such experience and share it with
your friends. Since weather is such a
complex phenomenon, it is not easy to
predict.

Fig. 7.2 Graph showing the variation of maximum temperature during 03 to 09 August 2006
As it is clear from any weather report
the maximum and minimum
temperatures are recorded every day. Do
you know how these temperatures are
recorded. In Chapter 4 you have learnt
that there are special thermometers for
this purpose, called maximum and
minimum thermometers. Can you
guess when during the day we have the
maximum temperature and when the
minimum?
The maximum temperature of the day
occurs generally in the afternoon while
the minimum temperature occurs
generally in the early morning. Can you
now understand why in summers we feel
so miserable in the afternoon and
comparatively comfortable early in the
morning?
I wonder why weather
changes so frequently!
What is the source of weather
7 in the first place?
All changes in the weather are caused by the sun. The sun is a huge sphere of
hot gases at a very high temperature. The distance of the sun from us is very
large. Even then the energy sent out by the sun is so huge that it is the source of
all heat and light on the earth. So, the sun is the primary source of energy that
causes changes in the weather. Energy absorbed and reflected by the earth's
surface, oceans and the atmosphere play important roles in determining the
weather at any place. If you live near the sea, you would have realised that the
weather at your place is different from that of a place in a desert, or near a mountain.

SCIENCE
What about the times of sunrise and
sunset? You know that in winters it
becomes dark early and you do not get
much time to play. Are the days shorter
in winter than in summer? Try to find
it out yourself by completing the project
given at the end of the chapter.
7.2 CLIMATE
Meteorologists record the weather every
day. The records of the weather have
been preserved for the past several
decades. These help us to determine the
weather pattern at a place. The average
weather pattern taken over a long
time, say 25 years, is called the
climate of the place. If we find that
the temperature at a place is high most
of the time, then we say that the climate
of that place is hot. If there is also heavy
rainfall on most of the days in the same
place, then we can say that the climate
of that place is hot and wet.
In Table 7.2 and 7.3, we have given
the climatic condition at two places in
India. The mean temperature for a given
month is found in two steps. First we
find the average of the temperatures
recorded during the month. Second, we
calculate the average of such average
temperatures over many years. That
gives the mean temperature. The two
places are: Srinagar in Jammu and
Kashmir, and Thiruvananthapuram in
Kerala.

WEATHER, CLIMATE AND ADAPTATIONS OF ANIMALS TO CLIMATE
71
By looking at Tables 7.2 and 7.3 we
can easily see the difference in the
climate of Jammu & Kashmir and
Kerala. We can see that Kerala is very
hot and wet in comparison to Jammu
& Kashmir, which has a moderately hot
and wet climate for a part of the year.
Similar data for the western region
of India, for example Rajasthan, will
show that the temperature is high
during most part of the year. But during
winter, which lasts only for a few
months, the temperature is quite low.
This region receives very little
rainfall. This is the typical desert
climate. It is hot and dry. The north-
eastern India receives rain for a major
part of the year. Therefore, we can say
that the climate of the north-east is wet.
7.3 CLIMATE AND ADAPTATION
Climate has a profound effect on all
living organisms.
Animals are adapted to survive in the
conditions in which they live. Animals
living in very cold and hot climate must
possess special features to protect
themselves against the extreme cold or
heat. Recall from Chapter 9 of your
Class VI science book the definition of
adaptation. Features and habits that
help animals to adapt to their
surroundings are a result of the process
of evolution.
In Chapter 9 you will learn about the
effect of weather and climate on soil.
Here we study the effect of climate on
animals only. In Class VI, you have read
about adaptations of animals to certain
habitats. As examples of adaptation of
animals to climatic conditions, we
discuss only animals living in polar
regions and tropical rainforests.
As the name suggests, the polar
regions are situated near the poles, i.e.,
north pole and south pole.
Some well-known countries that
belong to the polar regions are Canada,
Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Alaska in U.S.A. and Siberian
region of Russia.
Examples of some countries where
the tropical rainforests are found are
India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil,
Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and
Nigeria.
Activity 7.2
Take an outline map of the world. Mark
the polar regions in blue. Similarly,
mark the tropical regions in red.
(i) The polar regions
The polar regions present an extreme
climate. These regions are covered with
snow and it is very cold for most part of
the year. For six months the sun does
not set at the poles while for the other
six months the sun does not rise. In
winters, the temperature can be as low
as -37°C. Animals living there have
adapted to these severe conditions. Let
us see how they are adapted by
considering the examples of polar bears
and penguins.
Polar bears have white fur so that
they are not easily visible in the snowy
white background. It protects them from
72
SCIENCE
Another well-known animal living in
the polar regions is the penguin
(Fig. 7.4). It is also white and merges
well with the white background. It also
has a thick skin and a lot of fat to protect
it from cold. You may have seen pictures
of penguins huddled together. This they
do to keep warm. Recall how warm you
feel when you are in a hall full of people.
their predators. It also helps them in
catching their prey. To protect them
from extreme cold, they have two thick
layers of fur. They also have a layer of
fat under their skin. In fact, they are so
well-insulated that they have to move
slowly and rest often to avoid getting
overheated.
Physical activities on warm days
necessitate cooling. So, the polar bear
goes for swimming. It is a good
swimmer. Its paws are wide and large,
which help it not only to swim well but
also walk with ease in the snow. While
swimming under water, it can close its
nostrils and can remain under water for
long durations. It has a strong sense of
smell so that it can catch its prey
for food. We can understand the
adaptations of polar bears with the help
of the flow chart shown in Fig. 7.3.

long, birds must remain warm to
survive. They migrate to warmer regions
when winter sets in. They come back
after the winter is over. You know
probably that India is one of the
destinations of many of these birds. You
must have seen or heard about the
Siberian crane that comes from Siberia
to places like Bharatpur in Rajasthan
and Sultanpur in Haryana, and some
Fig. 7.5 Feet of penguin
Like polar bears, penguins are also good
swimmers. Their bodies are streamlined
and their feet have webs, making them
good swimmers (Fig. 7.5).
Other animals living in the polar
regions are many types of fishes, musk
oxen, reindeers, foxes, seals, whales,
and birds. It is to be noted that while
fish can remain under cold water for
Do fishes and butterflies
also migrate like birds?
Fig. 7.6 Migratory birds

Did you know?
Some migratory birds travel as much as 15000 km to escape the extreme climatic
conditions at home. Generally they fly high where the wind flow is helpful and
the cold conditions allow them to disperse the heat generated by their flight
muscles. But how these birds travel to the same place year after year is still a
mystery. It seems that these birds have a built-in sense of direction and know in
which direction to travel. Some birds probably use landmarks to guide them. Many
birds may be guided by the sun during the day and stars at night. There is some
evidence that birds may use the magnetic field of the earth to find direction. And
it is not only birds that migrate; mammals, many types of fish and insects are
also known to migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates.

wetlands of north east and some other
parts of India (Fig. 7.6).
(ii) The tropical rainforests
The tropical region has generally a hot
climate because of its location around
the equator. Even in the coldest month
the temperature is generally higher than
about 15°C. During hot summers, the
temperature may cross 40°C. Days and
nights are almost equal in length
throughout the year. These regions get
plenty of rainfall. An important feature
of this region is the tropical rainforests.
Tropical rainforests are found in
Western Ghats and Assam in India,
Southeast Asia, Central America and
Central Africa. Because of continuous
warmth and rain, this region supports
wide variety of plants and animals. The
major types of animals living in the
rainforests are monkeys, apes, gorillas,
lions, tigers, elephants, leopards, lizards,
snakes, birds and insects.
Let us read about the adaptations of
these animals to a hot, humid climate.
The climatic conditions in rainforests
are highly suitable for supporting an
enormous number and variety of
animals.
Since the numbers are large, there
is intense competition for food and
shelter. Many animals are adapted to
living on the trees. Red-eyed frog
(Fig. 7.7) has developed sticky pads on
its feet to help it climb trees on which it
lives. To help them live on the trees,
monkeys (Fig. 7.8) have long tails for
grasping branches. Their hands and feet
Fig. 7.8 A new world monkey
are such that they can easily hold on to
the branches.
As there is competition for food, some
animals are adapted to get food not
easily reachable. A striking example is
that of the bird Toucan (Fig. 7.9), which
possesses a long, large beak. This helps
a toucan to reach the fruits on branches
which are otherwise too weak to support
its weight.
Many tropical animals have sensitive
hearing, sharp eyesight, thick skin and
a skin colour which helps them to
camouflage by blending with the
surroundings. This is to protect them
from predators. For example, big cats

(Fig. 7.11). It has adapted to the
conditions of rainforests in many
remarkable ways. Look at its trunk. It
uses it as a nose because of which it
has a strong sense of smell. The trunk
is also used by it for picking up food.
Moreover, its tusks are modified teeth.
These can tear the bark of trees that
elephant loves to eat. So, the elephant
is able to handle the competition for food
rather well. Large ears of the elephant
help it to hear even very soft sounds.
They also help the elephant to keep cool
in the hot and humid climate of the
rainforest.

macaque
(lions and tigers) have thick skins and
sensitive hearing.
The lion-tailed macaque (also called
Beard ape) lives in the rainforests of
f
Western Ghats (Fig. 7.10). Its most
outstanding feature is the silver-white
mane, which surrounds the head from
the cheeks down to its chin. It is a good
climber and spends a major part of its
life on the tree. It feeds mainly on fruits.
It also eats seeds, young leaves, stems,
flowers and buds. This beard ape also
searches for insects under the bark of
the trees. Since it is able to get sufficient
food on the trees, it rarely comes down
on the ground.
Another well-known animal of Indian
tropical rainforest is the elephant

What you have learnt
The day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to
the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-speed, etc., is called the
weather at that place.
The weather is generally not the same on any two days and week after
week.
The maximum temperature of the day occurs generally in the afternoon
while the minimum temperature occurs in the early morning.
The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year.
All the changes in the weather are driven by the sun.
The average weather pattern taken over a long time, say 25 years, is
called the climate of the place.
The tropical and the polar regions are the two regions of the earth,
which have severe climatic conditions.
Animals are adapted to the conditions in which they live.
The polar regions are very cold throughout the year. The sun does not
set for six months in a year and in the other six months it does not rise.
Animals in the polar region are adapted to the extremely cold climate by
having some special characteristics such as white fur, strong sense of
smell, a layer of fat under the skin, wide and large paws for swimming
and walking, etc.
Migration is another means to escape the harsh, cold conditions.
Because of the hospitable climatic conditions huge populations of plants
and animals are found in the tropical rainforests.
Animals in the tropical rainforests are adapted such that they eat
different kinds of food to overcome the competition for food and shelter.
Some adaptations of animals living in the tropical rainforests include
living on the trees, development of strong tails, long and large beaks,
bright colours, sharp patterns, loud voice, diet of fruits, sensitive hearing,
sharp eyesight, thick skin, ability to camouflage in order to protect
themselves from predators, etc.

Winds, Storms and Cyclones
rissa was hit by a cyclone with
wind speed of 200 km/h on
18 October 1999. The cyclone
smashed 45,000 houses making
7,00,000 people homeless. On
29 October the same year, a second
cyclone with wind speed of 260 km/h
hit Orissa again. It was accompanied by
water waves about 9 m high. Thousands
of people lost their lives. Property worth
crores of rupees was destroyed. The
cyclone affected agriculture, transport,
communication, and electricity supply.
But, what are cyclones? How are
they formed? Why are they so
destructive? In this chapter we shall
seek answers to some of these questions.
We begin with some activities
involving air. These activities will clarify
some basic features concerning a
cyclone. Before we begin, remember that
the moving air is called the wind.
8.1 AIR EXERTS PRESSURE
Activity 8.1
Whenever an activity involves heating,
be very careful. It is advised that such
activities are performed in the
presence of an elderly person from
your family. Or, carry out these
activities in the presence of your
teacher.
You need to boil water in the following
activity.
Take a tin can with a lid. Fill it
approximately half with water. Heat the
can on a candle flame till the water boils.
Let the water boil for a few minutes. Blow
out the candle. Immediately put the lid
tightly on the can. Be careful in handling
the hot can. Put the can carefully in a
shallow metallic vessel or a washbasin.
Pour fresh water over the can.

is blowing. You can list some more
experiences which show that the air has
pressure.
Let us now try to explain why the
can (or the bottle) gets distorted. As
water is poured over the can, some
steam in the can condenses into water,
reducing the amount of air inside. The
pressure of air inside the can decreases
than the pressure exerted by the air
from outside the can. As a result the
can gets compressed.
This activity again confirms that air
exerts pressure.

Activity 8.2

Can you guess why the shape of the
can gets distorted?
If you cannot get a tin can, take a
soft plastic bottle. Fill it with hot water.
Empty the bottle and immediately cap
it tightly. Place the bottle under running
water.
Recall now some of your experiences.
When you fly a kite, does the wind
coming from your back help?
If you are in a boat, is it easier to
row it if there is wind coming from
behind you?
Do you find it difficult to ride a bicycle
against the direction of the wind.
You know that we have to fill air into
the bicycle tube to keep it tight. Also,
you know that a bicycle tube overfilled
with air may burst. What is the air doing
inside the tube?
Discuss with your friends how the
air in the bicycle tube keeps it in shape.
All these experiences show that the
air exerts pressure. It is due to this
pressure that the leaves of trees,
banners, or flags flutter when the wind

a ball of size smaller than the mouth of

the ball to force it into the bottle. Try
the activity with bottles of different sizes.

equal size. Put a little water into the

tie each one to a string. Hang the
balloons 8-10 cm apart on a cycle spoke
or a stick. Blow in the space between
the balloons.
What did you expect? What
happens?
Try different ways of blowing on the
balloons to see what happens.
Activity 8.4
Can you blow and lift?
Hold a strip of paper, 20 cm long and
3 cm wide, between your thumb and
forefinger as shown in the Fig. 8.5. Now
blow over the paper.
What do you think will happen to
the paper?
Let us try to understand the
observations in Activities 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.
Were the observations along the lines
you thought? Do you get the feeling
that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure?
When we blow into the mouth of the
bottle, the air near the mouth has higher
speed. This decreases the pressure
there. The air pressure inside the bottle
is higher than near the mouth. The air
inside the bottle pushes the ball out.
In Activity 8.3 you saw that when you
blew between the balloons, they moved

candle below one of the bags as shown
in the figure. Observe what happens.
Why is the balance of the bags
disturbed?
Does this activity indicate that warm
air rises up? As the warm air rises up,
it pushes the bag above the candle. Does
the disturbance of the balance suggest
that the warm air is lighter than the cold
air?
Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.
8.4 WIND CURRENTS ARE GENERATED
DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON
THE EARTH
These situations are:
(a) Uneven heating between
the equator and the poles
You might have learnt in Geography that
regions close to the equator get
maximum heat from the Sun. The air
in these regions gets warm. The warm
air rises, and the cooler air from the

regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.
(b) Uneven heating of land
and water
You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).
The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam', which means

The winds would have flown in the

8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.

that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

Extended Learning – Activities and Projects
1. You can perform the Activity 8.5 in the chapter slight
differently at home. Use two plastic bottles of the same size. Stretch one
balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.
2. You can make your own anemometer.
Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

• Do you see layers of particles of

Are there some dead rotting leaves

The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different
layers of the soil is called the soil profile.
Each layer differs in feel (texture),

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

perform some activities to find the
characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time

spill over or run down on the outside of
the pipe while pouring. Calculate the
rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)
percolation time (min)
For example, suppose that for a
certain sample, it took 20 minutes for
200 mL to percolate. So,

rate of percolation = = 10 mL/min

Calculate the rate of percolation in
your soil sample. Compare your findings
with others and arrange the soil samples
in the increasing order of the rate of
percolation.
9.5 MOISTURE IN SOIL
Have you ever passed through a
farmland during a hot summer day?
Perhaps you noticed that the air above
the land is shimmering. Why is it so?
Try out this activity and find the answer.
Activity 9.5
Take a boiling tube. Put two spoonfulls
of a soil sample in it. Heat it on a flame
(Fig. 9.6) and observe it. Let us find out
what happens upon heating.
Do you see water drops any where?
If yes, where did you find them?
On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.
9.6 ABSORPTION OF WATER BY SOIL
Do all the soils absorb water to the same
extent? Let us find out.
Activity 9.6
Take a plastic funnel. Take a filter paper
(or a piece of newspaper sheet), fold and
place it as shown in the figure. Weigh
50g of dry, powdered soil and pour it
into the funnel. Measure a certain
amount of water in a measuring cylinder
and pour it drop by drop on the soil.
You can use a dropper for this purpose.
Do not let all the water fall at one spot.

9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

What you have learnt
Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.

SCIENCE
Soil holds water in it, which is called soil moisture. The capacity of a soil
to hold water is important for various crops.
Clayey soil is used to make pots, toys and statues.

muscle cramps after heavy exercise? The
cramps occur when muscle cells respire
anaerobically. The partial breakdown of
glucose produces lactic acid. The
accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle
cramps. We get relief from cramps after a
hot water bath or a massage. Can you
guess why it is so? Hot water bath or
massage improves circulation of blood.
As a result, the supply of oxygen to the
muscle cells increases. The increase in
the supply of oxygen results in the
complete breakdown of lactic acid into
carbon dioxide and water.

rate of breathing will be the slowest and
in which it will be the fastest? Assign
numbers to the pictures in the order of
increasing rate of breathing according
to your experience.
10.3 How Do WE BREATHE?
Let us now learn about the mechanism
of breathing. Normally we take in air
through our nostrils. When we inhale
air, it passes through our nostrils into
the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity,
the air reaches our lungs through the
windpipe. Lungs are present in the
chest cavity (Fig. 10.4). This cavity is
surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,
muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 10.4).
Breathing involves the movement of the
diaphragm and the rib cage.
During inhalation, ribs move up and
outwards and diaphragm moves down.
This movement increases space in our
chest cavity and air rushes into the
lungs. The lungs get filled with air.
During exhalation, ribs move down and
inwards, while diaphragm moves up to
its former position. This reduces the size
of the chest cavity and air is pushed out
of the lungs (Fig. 10.5). These
movements in our body can be felt

The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust,
pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the
nasal cavity. Then they irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we
sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-
free, clean air enters our body.
TAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign
particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.

These openings are called spiracles
(Fig. 10.9). Insects have a network of air
tubes called tracheae for gas exchange.
Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles
into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the
body tissue, and reaches every cell of
the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from
the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and
moves out through spiracles. These air
tubes or tracheae are found only in
insects and not in any other group of

plants each part can independently take
in oxygen from the air and give out
carbon dioxide. You have already learnt

help in breathing. Gills are well supplied
with blood vessels (Fig. 10.10) for
exchange of gases.

What you have learnt
Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms. It releases energy
from the food.
The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide
and water. Energy is released in the process.
The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellular
respiration).
If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic
respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the
respiration is called anaerobic respiration.
During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is
insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.
Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an
organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon
dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different
organisms.
During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original
state as the air moves out during exhalation.
Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.
In animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and the
process of breathing are similar to those in humans.
In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In
fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.
In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores
called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of
glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings.

Transportation in Animals
and Plants
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 11.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in plants and animals.

Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is a liquid, which has
cells of various kinds suspended in it.
Ella
Why is the colour of
blood red?
Fig. 11.1 Circulatory system
(Arteries are shown in red colour and vein in blue)
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.
Activity 11.1
The fluid part of the blood is called
plasma.
One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin bind
with oxygen and transports it to all the
parts of the body and ultimately to all
the cells. It will be difficult to provide
oxygen efficiently to all the cells of
the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 10. So, two types of
blood vessels are present in the arteries
and veins of the body. (Fig. 11.1)
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 11.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.

I am confused! I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygen-rich blood.
2010
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart.
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.

Refer to Fig. 11.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels. On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join up to
form veins which empty into the heart.
Heart
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 11.1). Hold your

makes your fist. Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four
chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 11.4). The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your
heart by listening through a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.

carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heartbeats. How many times did your
heartbeat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4-5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and
heartbeat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 11.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heartbeat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heartbeat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not posses any
circulatory system. The water in which
they live brings food and oxygen as it
enters their bodies. The water carries
away waste materials and carbon dioxide
as it moves out. Thus, these animals do
not need a circulatory fluid like the
blood.
Let us now learn about the remova
of waste other than carbon dioxide.
11.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells perform their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion forms the excretory system.
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578-1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called “circulator”. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harvey's idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.

contains water and salts. Boojho has
seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat.
Does sweat serve any other function?
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot, which causes cooling.

whether other animals also
urinate?

The way in which waste chemicals are
removed from the body of the animal
depends on the availability of water.
Aquatic animals like fishes, excrete cell
waste in gaseous form (ammonia)
which directly dissolves in water. Some
land animals like birds, lizards,
snakes excrete a semi-solid, white
coloured compound (uric acid). The
major excretory product in humans
is urea.
tube-like ureters. It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 11.6).
The kindeys, ureters, bladder and
urethra form the excretory system.
An adult human being normally
passes about 1-1.8 L of urine in 24
hours, and the urine consists of 95%
water, 2.5 % urea and 2.5% other waste
products.
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day. The sweat
Sometimes a person's kidneys may
stop working due to infection or
injury. As a result of kidney failure,
waste products start accumulating in
the blood. Such persons cannot
survive unless their blood is filtered
periodically through an artificial
kidney. This process is called dialysis.

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 11.7 (b)].

level of sugar solution. How did water
get inside the potato? For very short
distances water can move from one cell
to another. In the same way water
reaches xylem vessels of the root from
the soil [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants release
a lot of water by the process of
transpiration.
Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil. Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant. The
water evaporates through the stomata
present on the surface of the leaves by

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products to
different parts of the body for excretion.
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.
In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.
Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.
The human heart beats about 70-80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a
urinary bladder, and urethra.
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.
130
SCIENCE
Fish excrete waste substances which directly dissolve in water.
Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.
Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil.
Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the
vascular tissue called xylem.
The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the
plant is phloem.
A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata
during transpiration.
Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the
roots from the soil, to reach the stem and leaves.

lo produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms. You have already
learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
12.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? The flowers perform the function
of reproduction in plants. Flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. A
flower may have either the male part or
the female part or both male and female
parts.
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring. These are
categorised into two types: (i) asexual,
D
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds or
spores.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Sind
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.

You must have seen flower buds
developing into flowers. Apart from
flower buds, there are buds in the axil
(point of attachment of the leaf at the
node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 12.2). A bud consists of a
short stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are folded. The
vegetative buds can also give rise to new
plants.

on it with the help of a magnifying glass.

nutrients are made available to them.

organism. Let us see how they
reproduce?

powder from a bakery or a chemist shop.

it. Keep it in the warm part of a room.
After an hour, put a drop of this liquid
on a glass slide and observe under a
microscope. What do you observe? You
may see the formation of new yeast cells

Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.

135
Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

are released they keep floating in the
air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a

The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)

a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a

Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

Motion and Time
'n Class VI, you learnt about different
types of motions. You learnt that a
-motion could be along a straight line,
it could be circular or periodic. Can you
recall these three types of motions?
Table 13.1 gives some common
examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.

13.1 SLOW OR FAST
We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast.
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other.
Activity 13.1
Look at Fig. 13.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 13.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to
move. The distance covered by you after

It is common experience that the
motion of some objects is slow while that
of some others is fast.

direction on a road
it is easy to decide whose speed
is the highest. One who takes
shortest time to cover the
distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.
13.2 SPEED
You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
slower. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed
for one hour. In fact, it starts moving
slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of
a simple pendulum.
a constant speed or not during that
hour. The speed calculated here is
actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,
an Total distance covered
Total time taken
In everyday life we seldom find objects
| moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.
We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.
13.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME
If you did not have a clock, how would
you decide what time of the day it is?
Have you ever wondered how our elders
could tell the approximate time of the
day by just looking at shadows?
How do we measure time interval of
a month? A year?
Our ancestors noticed that many
events in nature repeat themselves after
definite intervals of time. For example,

cells. These clocks are called quartz
clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that
by the clocks available earlier.
Units of time and speed
The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.

There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 -1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.
MOTION AND TIME
147
Different units of time are used
depending on the need. For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from ""two thousand and one"" to ""two
thousand and ten"". The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds. This rate may be
slightly higher for children.
Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 13.5).
13.4 MEASURING SPEED
Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.
Activity 13.3
Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 13.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?
GE
Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.
The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

Take a sheet of graph paper. Draw
two lines perpendicular to each other
on it, as shown in Fig. 13.11. Mark the
horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as
the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical
line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point
of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is
known as the origin O. The two
quantities between which the graph is
drawn are shown along these two axes.
We show the positive values on the
x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive
values on the y-axis are shown along
OY. In this chapter we shall consider
only the positive values of quantities.
You can make the graph by following
the steps given below:
Draw two perpendicular lines to
represent the two axes and mark
them as OX and OY as in Fig. 13.11.

along the x-axis and that to be

Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm
Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, ... on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km ... on the y-axis (Fig. 13.12).
Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 13.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 13.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the
points corresponding to different
sets of values.

as simple as in the example given above.
We may have to choose two different scales
to represent the desired quantities on the
x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to
understand this process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 13.5. The total distance covered
by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to
choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall
have to draw an axis of length 80 cm.
This is not possible on a sheet of paper.
On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1
cm would require an axis of length only
8 cm. This scale is quite convenient.
However, the graph may cover only a
small part of the graph paper. Some of
the points to be kept in mind while
choosing the most suitable scale for
drawing a graph are:
the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.
the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and
to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that we have a graph paper
of size 25 cm 25 cm. One of the scales
which meets the above conditions and
can accommodate the data of Table 13.5
could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm
Can you now draw the distance-time
graph for the motion of the bus? Is the
graph drawn by you similar to that
shown in Fig. 13.13?
Distance-time graphs provide a
variety of information about the motion
154
SCIENCE
when compared to the data presented
by a table. For example, Table 13.5 gives
information about the distance moved
by the bus only at some definite time
intervals. On the other hand, from the
distance-time graph we can find the
distance moved by the bus at any
instant of time. Suppose we want to
know how much distance the bus had
travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point
corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on
the x-axis. Suppose this point is A. Next
we draw a line perpendicular to the
x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at
point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 13.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the
y-axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How muc
is this distance in km? Can you now
help Paheli to find the distance moved
by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also
find the speed of the bus from its
distance-time graph?

What you have Learnt
The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.
Speed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the
other.
The speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time taken
to cover that distance. Its basic unit is metre per second (m/s).
Periodic events are used for the measurement of time. Periodic motion of
a pendulum has been used to make clocks and watches.
Motion of objects can be presented in pictorial form by their
distance-time graphs.
The distance-time graph for the motion of an object moving with a constant
speed is a straight line.

1. You can make your own sundial and use it to mark the time of the day at
your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an
atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle
is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of
a circular board a shown in Fig. 13.16. One way to fix the gnomon could
be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.
Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 13.16. Mark the position of the tip
of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day
as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow
every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked
by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 13.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use
this sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember that
the gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction as
shown in Fig. 13.16.

4. You can perform an interesting activity when you visit a park to ride a
swing. You will require a watch. Make the swing oscillate without
anyone sitting on it. Find its time period in the same way as you did for
the pendulum. Make sure that there are no jerks in the motion of the
swing. Ask one of your friends to sit on the swing. Push
it once and let it swing naturally. Again measure its time period.
Repeat the activity with different persons sitting on the swing. Compare
the time period of the swing measured in different cases. What
conclusions do you draw from this activity?
Did you know?
The time-keeping services in India are provided by the National Physical
Laboratory, New Delhi. The clock they use can measure time intervals
with an accuracy of one-millionth of a second. The most accurate clock
in the world has been developed by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology in the U.S.A. This clock will lose or gain one second after
running for 20 million years.

Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
| touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come

cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the

socket. This may cause overload in

reports in newspapers about fires

overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?

compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.
14.4 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 14.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6-10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 14.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.
14.5 ELECTRIC BELL
We are quite familiar with an electric bell.
It has an electromagnet in it. Let us see
how it works.
Fig. 14.20 shows the circuit of an
electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire
wound on an iron piece. The coil acts

SCIENCE
as an electromagnet. An iron strip with
a hammer at one end is kept close to
the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,
pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.

What you have learnt
It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols. Using these,
an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram.
When an electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets heated. It is
the heating effect of current. This effect has many applications.
Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed through them. These materials are
used for making electric fuses which prevent fires and damage to electric
appliances.
When an electric current flows through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
A current carrying coil of an insulated wire wrapped around a piece of
iron is called an electromagnet.
Electromagnets are used in many devices.

1. Set up the circuit shown in Fig. 14.17 again. Move the key to ‘ON'
position and watch carefully in which direction the compass needle
gets deflected. Switch 'OFF' the current. Now keeping rest of the circuit
intact, reverse the connections at the terminal of the cell. Again switch
‘on’ the current. Note the direction in which the needle gets deflected.
Think of an explanation.
2. Make four electromagnets with 20, 40, 60 and 80 turns. Connect them
one by one to a battery of 2 cells. Bring the electromagnet near a box of

of the electromagnets.
Paheli and Boojho saw a magic trick sometime back. The magician placed
an iron box on a stand. He then called Boojho and asked him to lift the
box. Boojho could easily lift the box. Now the magician made a show of
moving his stick around the box while muttering some thing. He again
asked Boojho to lift the box. This time Boojho could not even move it. The
magician again muttered some thing and now Boojho could lift the box.
The audience, including Paheli and Boojho, were very impressed with
the show and felt that the magician had some supernatural powers.
However, after reading this chapter Paheli is wondering if the trick was
indeed some magic or some science was involved? Can you guess what
science might be involved?

The credit for the invention of the electric bulb
is usually given to Thomas Alva Edison, though
others before him had worked on it. Edison
was a remarkable man. He made some 1300
inventions including the electric bulb,
gramophone, the motion picture camera and
the carbon transmitter, which facilitated the
invention of the telephone.

You have learnt in Class VI that a
mirror changes the direction of light that
falls on it. This change of direction by a
mirror is called reflection of light. Can
you recall the activity in which you got
the light of a torch reflected from a
mirror? Let us perform a similar activity.

a straight pipe and then through
a bent pipe (Fig. 15.2). Why was
Boojho not able to see the candle
flame through a bent pipe?
This activity showed that
light travels along straight lines.
How can we change the path
of light? Do you know, what
happens when light falls on a
polished or a shiny surface?
15.2 REFLECTION OF LIGHT
One way to change the direction
of light is to let it fall on a shiny
surface. For example, a shining
stainless steel plate or a shining
steel spoon can change the
direction of light. The surface of
water can also act like a mirror
and change the path of light.

of trees or buildings in water

Handle the lighted candle with care.
It is better if this activity is performed
in the presence of a teacher or an elder
person.

mirror strip vertically on the chart paper
(Fig. 15.5). Now direct the beam of light
on the mirror from the torch with slits.
Place the torch in such a way that its
light is seen along the chart paper on
the board. Now adjust its position so
that the light from the torch strikes the
plane mirror at an angle (Fig. 15.5).
Does the mirror change the direction
of light that falls on it? Now move the
torch slightly to either side. Do you find
any change in the direction of reflected
light?
Look into the mirror along the
direction of the reflected light. Do you
Place a lighted candle in front of a
plane mirror. Try to see the flame of the
candle in the mirror. It appears as if a
similar candle is placed behind the
mirror. The candle, which appears
behind the mirror, is the image of the
candle formed by the mirror (Fig. 15.6).
The candle itself is the object.
Now move the candle to different
positions in front of the mirror. Observe
the image in each case.
Paheli wants to know, what
makes things visible to us?
Boojho thinks that objects are
visible only when light reflected
from them reaches our eyes. Do
you agree with him?
Fig. 15.6 Image of a candle in a plane mirror
176
SCIENCE
Boojho noted in his notebook: Is
it not surprising that my image is
of the same size as me whether
the mirror is small or large?
Was the image upright in each case?
Did the flame appear on top of the candle
as in the object? Such an image is called
erect. An image formed by a plane
mirror is erect and of the same size as
the object.
Now place a vertical screen behind
the mirror. Try to obtain the image of
the candle on this screen. Can you get
the image on the screen? Now place the
screen in front of the mirror. Can you
get the image on the screen now? You
will find that the image of the candle
cannot be obtained on the screen in
either case.
What about the distance of the image
from mirror? Let us perform another
activity.
Activity 15.3
Take a chess board. If a chess board is
not available, draw on a chart paper 64
(88) squares of equal size. Draw a thick
line in the middle of the paper. Fix a
plane mirror vertically on this line. Place
any small object, such as a pencil
sharpner, at the boundary of the third
square counting from the mirror
(Fig. 15.7). Note the position of the
image. Now shift the object to the
boundary of the fourth square. Again
note the position of the image. Did you
find any relation between the distance
of the image from the mirror and that of
the object in front of it?
Fig. 15.7 Locating image in a plane mirror
Paheli made a note in her notebook:
In a plane mirror the image is
formed behind the mirror. It is erect,
of the same size and is at the same
distance from the mirror as the
object is in front of it.
You will find that the image
is at the same distance behind
the mirror as the object is in front
of it. Now verify this by placing
the object anywhere on the chart
paper.

manner.
Can you now understand
why the word ‘AMBULANCE' is written
as in Fig. 15.9? When the driver of a
vehicle ahead of an ambulance looks in
her/his rear view mirror, s/he can read
‘AMBULANCE' written on it and give

us to allow an ambulance to pass
without blocking its way.
You might have observed that in the

Now look at your image using the
inner side of the spoon. This time you
may find that your image is erect and
larger in size. If you increase the distance
of the spoon from your face, you may
see your image inverted (Fig. 15.11). You
can also compare the image of your pen
or pencil instead of your face.
15.4 PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL
MIRRORS
Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their
dinner. Boojho lifted a stainless steel
plate and saw his image in it. Oh! This
plate acts as a plane mirror. My image
is erect and is of the same size. Paheli
saw her image using the back of a steel
spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind”, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image.
Activity 15.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it. Do you see your image
in it (Fig. 15.10)? Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?
Fig. 15.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon
The curved shining surface of a
spoon acts as a mirror. The most
common example of a curved mirror is
a spherical mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 15.12).

Why are concave and convex mirrors
called spherical mirrors?
Take a rubber ball and cut a
portion of it with a knife or a hack-
saw blade (Fig. 15.13 (a)]. (Be careful.
Ask an elder person to help you in
cutting the ball). The inner surface
of the cut ball is called concave and
the outer surface is called convex
(Fig. 15.13 (b)).

The inner surface of a spoon acts like
a concave mirror, while its outer surface
acts like a convex mirror.
We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.
Activity 15.6
Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 15.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 15.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror.
Activity 15.7
CAUTION
You will conduct Activity 15.6 in the
sunlight. Be careful, never look
directly towards the sun or its image
as it may damage your eyes. You may
look at the image of the sun when it
is thrown on a screen or a wall.
Fix a concave mirror on a stand (any
arrangement to keep the mirror steady
would do) and place it on a table
(Fig. 15.15). Paste a piece of white paper
on a cardboard sheet (say about

Keep a lighted candle on the table at a
distance of about 50 cm from the mirror.
Try to obtain the image of the flame on
the screen. For this, move the screen till
a sharp image of the flame is obtained
Make sure that, the screen does not
obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror. Is this image real or
virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame?
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 15.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 15.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
(Fig. 15.17). The reflectors of torches,
headlights of cars and scooters are
concave in shape (Fig. 15.18).

size than the object?
Can you now recognise the mirrors
used as side mirrors in scooters? These
are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can
form images of objects spread over a large
area. So, these help the drivers to see
the traffic behind them (Fig. 15.20).
15.5 IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES
You might have seen a magnifying glass.
It is used to read very small print
(Fig. 15.21). You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a
cockroach or an earthworm. The
magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.
Lenses are widely used in spectacles,
telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.
Get some lenses. Touch and feel
them. Can you find some difference just
by touching? Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges
are convex lenses (Fig. 15.22 (a)]. Those

Activity 15.9
Take a convex lens or magnifying glass.
Put it in the path of sunrays. Place a
sheet of paper as shown (Fig. 15.23).

the paper till you get a bright spot on
the paper. Hold the lens and the paper
in this position for a few minutes. Does
the paper begin to burn?
Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens. Do you see a bright spot
A convex lens converges (bends
inward) the light generally falling on it
[Fig. 15.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a
converging lens. On the other hand, a
concave lens diverges (bends outward)
the light and is called a diverging lens
[Fig. 15.24 (b)].

you not getting a bright spot this time?
We have seen in the case of mirrors
that for different positions of the object
the nature and size of the image change.
Is it true for lenses also?
Let us find out.
Activity 15.10
Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand
as you did with the concave mirror. Place
it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a
distance of about 50 cm from the lens
[Fig. 15.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image
of the candle on a paper screen placed
on the other side of the lens. You may
have to move the screen towards or away
from the lens to get a sharp image of
the flame. What kind of image did you
get? Is it real or virtual?
Now vary the distance of the candle
from the lens [Fig. 15.25 (b)]. Try to
obtain the image of the candle flame
every time on the paper screen by
moving it. Record your observations as
you did in Activity 15.7 for the concave
mirror.
It means that we can see the

In a similar fashion study the images

it may not be easy to distinguish all of
them. These are — red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo and violet.
You might have seen that when you

What you have learnt
Light travels along straight lines.
Any polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.
An image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.
An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.
The image formed by a plane mirror is erect. It is virtual and is of the
same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.
In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on the
right side in the image, and right side of the object appears to be on the
left side in the image.
A concave mirror can form a real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified.
Image formed by a convex mirror is erect, virtual and smaller in size
than the object.
A convex lens can forms real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is called
a magnifying glass.
A concave lens always forms erect, virtual and smaller image than the
object.
White light is composed of seven colours.

3. Make a rainbow
Try to make your own rainbow. You can try this project in the morning
or in the evening. Stand with your back towards the sun. Take a hosepipe
or a water pipe used in the garden. Make a fine spray in front of you.
You can see different colours of rainbow in the spray.
4. Visit a laughing gallery in some science centre or a science park or a
village mela. You will find some large mirrors there. You can see your
distorted and funny images in these mirrors. Try to find out the kind of
mirrors used there.
5. Visit a nearby hospital. You can also visit the clinic of an ENT
specialist, or a dentist. Request the doctor to show you the mirrors used
for examining ear, nose, throat and teeth. Can you recognise the kind of
mirror used in these instruments?
6. Role play
Here is a game that a group of children can play. One child will be
chosen to act as object and another will act as the image of the object.
The object and the image will sit opposite to each other. The object will
make movements, such as raising a hand, touching an ear, etc. The
image will have to make the correct movement following the movement
of the object. The rest of the group will watch the movements of the
image. If the image fails to make the correct movement, she/he will be
retired. Another child will take her/his place and the game will
continue. A scoring scheme can be introduced. The group that scores
the maximum will be declared the winner.

The mirrors can be used as weapons. Archimedes, a Greek scientist, is said
to have done just that more than two thousand years ago. When the
Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 15.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an
example of triumph of ideas over military might.

group. Some of the posters presented
on that day are shown in Fig. 16.1.

teachers must very often be advising you
not to waste water. No wonder we
celebrate water day every year to attract
the attention of everybody towards the
importance of conserving water.
The amount of water recommended
by the United Nations for drinking,
washing, cooking and maintaining proper
hygiene is a minimum of 50 litres per
person per day. This amount is about
two and a half buckets of water per
person per day. Is your family getting at
least this much of water? If yes, you
should consider yourself fortunate
because millions of people in our
country do not get enough water. What
about your friends and their families?
Share your experience with them.
In some places there is an acute
shortage of water. Taps running dry,
long queues for water (Fig. 16.2), fights,
marches and protests for demand of
water have become a common sight,
especially during summers. Some of the
newspaper clippings shown in Fig. 16.3

Collect clippings from newspapers and
magazines on the news items, articles
and pictures related to water shortage.
Paste them in your scrapbook and share

Water shortage has become a matter
of concern throughout the world. It is
estimated that in a few years from now
more than one third of the people in
the world could face water scarcity.
Before we discuss why water is
getting scarce we must know how much
water is available for use on our planet.
16.1 HOW MUCH WATER IS AVAILABLE
Look at the picture of the earth taken
from space. Why does it appear blue?
Surely, you can guess!
You are aware that about 71% of
the earth's surface is covered with
water. Almost all the water on the
earth is contained in the seas and
oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as
groundwater and in the atmosphere.
However, most of this water is not fit for
human consumption. The water that is
fit for use is freshwater. Perform the

finding worry you? Discuss this in your
class.
16.2 FORMS OF WATER
Are you afraid that continuous use will
some day exhaust all the water available
for use? You know that water on the
earth has been maintained for millions
of years by various processes which
make the water cycle. You have studied
the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your
own words what you know about the
water cycle.
You know that when water circulates
through the water cycle it can be found
in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid
and gas—at any given time somewhere
on the earth. The solid form, snow and
ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of
the earth, snow-covered mountains and
glaciers. Liquid water is present in
oceans, lakes, rivers, and even
underground. The gaseous form is the
water vapour present in the air around
us. The continuous cycling of water
among its three forms keeps the total
amount of water on the earth constant
even when the whole world is using it.
Does it give you any relief?
Can you recall the processes involved
in water cycle? The following activity will
help you.

SCIENCE
bodies. The water is drawn from
nearby lakes, rivers, ponds or
wells. The water is supplied
through a network of pipes.
Many villages do not have such
a water supply system. There
people fetch water directly from
the sources. Often women and
children have to walk several
kilometres to fetch water
(Fig. 16.6). The children suffer
a lot. They cannot attend
school regularly since they
spend hours in fetching water.
Women have to
perform a number of
household chores. If they have
also to spend time to fetch water
it adds to their burden.
A large number of people draw water
from wells, tube wells or hand pumps.
From where do these sources get water?
16.3 GROUNDWATER AS AN IMPORTANT
SOURCE OF WATER
If we dig a hole in the ground near a
water body we may find that the soil is
moist. The moisture in the soil indicates
the presence of water underground. If
we dig deeper and deeper, we would
reach a level where all the space between
particles of soil and gaps between rocks
are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The
upper limit of this layer is called the
water table. The water table varies from
Fig. 16.6 Women fetching water
place to place, and it may even change
at a given place. The water table may be
at a depth of less than a metre or may
be several metres below the ground. The
water found below the water table is
called groundwater. What is the source
of this groundwater?
The rainwater and water from other
sources such as rivers and ponds seeps
through the soil and fills the empty
spaces and cracks deep below the
ground. The process of seeping of water
into the ground is called infiltration.
The groundwater thus gets recharged
by this process. At places the
groundwater is stored between layers of
hard rock below the water table. This is
known as an aquifer. Water in the
aquifers can be usually pumped out with
the help of tube wells or handpumps.
Have you ever been to a site where
construction work is going on? From

where do the workers get water for
construction? May be you have seen
boring being done at such sites to reach
the water table. Enquire from the people
working there how deep they have to dig.
Can we keep on drawing water from
under the ground? How will it affect the
water table?
16.4 DEPLETION OF WATER TABLE
Water drawn from under the ground gets
replenished by seepage of rainwater. The
water table does not get affected as long
as we draw as much water as is
replenished by natural processes.
However, water table may go down if the
water is not sufficiently replenished.
This may happen due to many reasons.
Increase in population, industrial and
agricultural activities are some common
factors affecting water table. Scanty
rainfall is another factor that may
deplete the water table. Yet another
factor affecting water table could be
deforestation and decrease in the
effective area for seepage of water.
Increasing population
Increasing population creates demand
for construction of houses, shops,
offices, roads and pavements. This
decreases the open areas like parks, and
playgrounds. This, in turn, decreases the
seepage of rainwater into the ground.
What could be the consequence? Recall
that a pukka floor does not allow water
to seep in easily, while in a grass lawn
water seeps through in no time.
198
SCIENCE
Moreover a huge amount of water is
required for construction work. Often
groundwater is used for this purpose.
So, on the one hand we are
consuming more groundwater, and on
the other we are allowing lesser water
to seep into the ground. This results in
depletion of water table. In fact, the
water table in some parts of many cities
has gone down to alarmingly low levels.
Increasing industries
Water is used by all the industries.
Almost everything that we use needs
water somewhere in its production
process. The number of industries is
increasing continuously. Water used by
most of the industries is drawn from the
ground.
day by day. This results in depletion of
water table.
16.5 DISTRIBUTION OF WATER
The distribution of water over the globe
is quite uneven due to a number of
factors.
Some places have good amount of
rain and are water-rich. On the other
hand, there are deserts which have
scanty rainfall.
India is a vast country and the
rainfall is not the same everywhere.
Some regions have excessive rains while
some others have very little rainfall.
Excessive rains cause floods, whereas
the absence of rains results in droughts.
Therefore, some regions in our country
may have floods while others may suffer
from droughts at the same time.
Activity 16.5
Activity 16.4
Name some industries familiar to you.
Make a list of the products obtained
from these and used in our daily life.
Discuss with your teacher and parents
how the growing industrial activity is
responsible for the depletion of water
table.
Agricultural activities
A majority of farmers in India depend
upon rains for irrigating their crops.
Irrigation systems such as canals are
there only in a few places. Even these
systems may suffer from lack of water
due to erratic rainfall. Therefore, farmers
have to use groundwater for irrigation.
Population pressure on agriculture
forces increasing use of groundwater
Given here is the rainfall map of India
(Fig. 16.8). It gives the average annual
rainfall in different regions of our country.
Locate on the map the place you live
in.
Are you blessed with sufficient
rainfall?
Is there sufficient water available in
your area throughout the year?
It may be possible that we are living
in an area where there is sufficient
rainfall yet there is shortage of water. Can
we attribute this to mismanagement of
water resources?

provided by a well-planned pipe system.
When the civic authorities supply water
through pipes not all of it may reach
the destination. You might have seen
water supply pipes leaking and a lot of
water gushing out of the pipes. It is
the responsibility of the civic
authorities to prevent such wastage of
precious water.
Mismanagement or wastage may
take place at the level of individuals also.
All of us, knowingly or unknowingly,
waste water while brushing teeth,
shaving, bathing, washing and during
many other activities. Leaking taps is
another source of huge water wastage.
We waste water as though we do not need
water the next time!
We have seen that most of the water
that we get as rainfall just flows away.
This is a waste of precious natural
resource. The rainwater can be used to
recharge the groundwater. This is
referred to as water harvesting or
rainwater harvesting, about which you
have learnt in Class VI.
Find out if the buildings in your
neighbourhood have water harvesting
systems installed.
We have at many places in India an
age old practice of water storage and
water recharge like the bawris. Bawri
was the traditional way of collecting
water. With time the bawris fell into
disuse and garbage started piling in these
reservoirs. However, because of the acute
water shortage, people in these areas
have had to rethink. The bawris are being
revived. Today the situation is that inspite
of scanty rains these places are
managing their water needs well.
A farmer using water in the field can
also use water economically. Maybe
you have heard of drip irrigation
(Fig. 16.9). Drip irrigation is a technique
of watering plants by making use of
narrow tubings which deliver water
directly at the base of the plant.
A case study
Bhujpur in the Kutch area of Gujarat has a very erratic rainfall. The only source
of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water
throughout the year. Over the years, demand for water has grown. The withdrawal
of groundwater has far exceeded recharge. As a result the water table has gone
down alarmingly.
In 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to
harvest rainwater. Eighteen check-dams were built on the Rukmavati river and
its many tributaries. The water so collected increased percolation through the
soil and recharged the aquifers.
According to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into
the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation.

16.7 WHAT ROLE YOU CAN PLAY
Have you ever shown concern if you saw
a tap leaking in your house, school or
any other place? Leaking taps waste a
lot of water. You must make efforts to
stop this leakage.
There are a number of ways you can
adopt to minimise the wastage of water.
Let us begin. We have given a few
examples. Add on!
16.8 EFFECT OF WATER SCARCITY ON
PLANTS
You must have seen potted plants
wilting and ultimately drying up if they
did not get water even for a few days.
You have already learnt in Chapter 1
that plants need water to get nutrients
from the soil to prepare their food. Just
imagine the consequences if water is not
available to plants!
The green character of the planet
shall be lost. This may mean the end
of all life, for a world without plants
shall mean no food, no oxygen, not
enough rain, and innumerable other
problems.
A successful initiative
Rajasthan is a hot and dry place. The challenge of natural scarcity of water was
met by a successful experiment. A band of social workers has transformed a dry
area in the Alwar district into a green place. They have revived five dried-up
rivers — Arveri, Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahazwali by constructing water-
harvesting structures.

SCIENCE
What you have learnt
Water is essential for all living beings. There can be no life without it.
Water exists in three forms: solid, liquid and vapour.
Though water is maintained by the water cycle, yet there is an acute
scarcity of water in many parts of the globe.
There is an uneven distribution of water. Much of it has resulted from
human activities.
Rapid growth of industries, increasing population, growing irrigation
requirements and mismanagement are some of the causes for water
shortage.
We need to be worried about the wastage during the supply of water
through pipes, the leaking taps in buildings and other places.
Unnecessary use of water and overdrawing from groundwater should be
avoided. Recharge of water to the ground should be increased.
The need of the hour is that every individual uses water economically.
Plants wilt and ultimately dry-up if they are not watered for a few days.

ne evening Boojho entered the
park with an elderly person. He
introduced him to his friends.
Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in
the university. The children started
playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a
bench in the corner. He was tired as he
had participated in the golden jubilee
celebrations of the town. After a while,
the children also came and sat around
him. They wanted to know about the
celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that
after the cultural programme, the
senior people discussed the town's
unemployment problem. A plan was
proposed to put up a factory by clearing
an area of the forest just outside the
town. This would give the increasing
population of the town a chance to get
jobs. The children were very surprised
when Prof Ahmad told them that many
people had objected to this idea.
“This is because the forests serve as
green lungs and water purifying systems
in nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The
children were confused. Prof Ahmad
realised that the children had not visited
a forest. The children also wanted to
know more about the forest, so they
decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.
17.1 VISIT TO A FOREST
One Sunday morning, the children
packed a few things like a knife, a hand
lens, a stick, a notebook and walked
together through a forest trail near a
village. On their way, they met Tibu, a
young boy of their age group, of nearby
village, who was taking cattle for grazing
along with his aunt. He was very agile,
running here and there to keep the herd
together. When he saw the children,
Tibu also started walking along with
them, while his aunt went on a different
path. As soon as they entered the forest
Tibu raised his hand and signalled them
to keep quiet because noise could
disturb the animals living in the forest.
Tibu then took them to a place at a
height to show them the broad view of
the forest. Children were surprised
because they could not see any land
(Fig. 17.1). The different treetops had
formed green cover over the land. However,
the cover was not uniformly green. The

M
environment was peaceful and a cool
breeze was blowing. This made children
quite fresh and happy.
While coming down, they got excited
on hearing a sudden sound of birds and
some noise from the top branches of the
trees. Tibu told them to relax since it
was a normal phenomenon here.
Because of the children's presence, some
monkeys had climbed higher up on the
trees where they disturbed the birds.
Animals often give this type of warning
call to alert other animals. Tibu also told
that many other animals like boar,
bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live
in the deeper areas of the forest
(Fig. 17.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned
children that they should not go deep
into the forest.
Boojho and Paheli remembered that
they have studied about forests as

The land where the children were
walking was uneven and covered with
many trees. Tibu helped them to identify
sal, teak, semal, sheesham, neem,
palash, fig, khair, amla, bamboo,
kachnar (Fig. 17.4). Prof Ahmad pointed
out that there are several other trees,
shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.
The trees were also covered with different
types of creepers and climbers. The sun
was barely visible through the leaves of
the trees, making it quite dark inside
the forest.
Activity 17.1
Observe the various things in your home
and make a list of those which are made
from material which may have been
obtained from the forest.
You might have many wooden items
on your list like plywood, fuel wood,
boxes, paper, matchsticks, and
furniture. Do you know that gum, oils,
spices, fodder for animals and medicinal
plants are also some of the products
which we get from the forest (Fig. 17.5).

Sheila wondered who would have
planted these trees. Prof Ahmad replied
that in nature trees produce enough
seeds. The forest floor provides
favourable conditions for them to
germinate and develop into seedlings
Honey

Prof Ahmad asked children to look
up and observe how the branches of the
tall trees look like a roof over the other
plants in the forest. He told them that
this is called a canopy (Fig. 17.7).
Activity 17.2
Visit a forest or a park in your
neighbourhood. Observe the trees and
try to identify them. You can take the
help of some elders or books on trees.
List the characteristics of the trees that
you observe, such as the height, shape
of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also
draw the crowns of some trees.
Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees
had crowns of different types and sizes.
These had created different horizontal
layers in the forest. These are known as
understoreys (Fig. 17.7). Giant and tall
trees constituted the top layer followed
by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs
formed the lowest layer.
“Would we see similar kind of trees
in every forest?” — asked Boojho.
Prof Ahmad said, “No, due to different
climatic conditions there are variations
in the types of trees and other plants.
The types of animals also differ from

Children picked up various seeds

Is the decaying matter always warm?
Prof Ahmad suggested that the children
could perform an activity to get an
answer to this question.

Paheli asked, “There are so many
trees here. Also, there are many forest
like this. What difference will it make if
we cut some trees for a factory?”
Prof Ahmad said, “You have read
about autotrophs, heterotrophs and
saprotrophs. You have learnt how green
plants produce food. All animals,
whether herbivores or carnivores,
depend ultimately on plants for food.
Organisms which feed on plants often
get eaten by other organisms, and so
on. For example, grass is eaten by
insects, which in turn, is taken by the
frog. The frog is consumed by snakes.
This is said to form a food chain:
Grass → insects → frog → snake → eagle.
Many food chains can be found in the
forest. All food chains are linked. If any
one food chain is disturbed, it affects
other food chains. Every part of the
forest is dependent on the other parts.
If we remove one component, say trees,
all other components would be affected.”

up leaves from the forest floor and

plants release oxygen through the
process of photosynthesis. The plants
help to provide oxygen for animal
respiration. They also maintain the
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere (Fig. 17.10). That is
why forests are called lungs.

decaying leaves. They also saw an army
of tiny insects, millipedes, ants and
beetle on them. They were wondering
how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad
explained that apart from these animals
which are easily seen, there are several
organisms and micro-organisms that
live in the soil. Paheli wondered what
mushroom and other micro-organisms
eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed
upon the dead plant and animal tissues
and convert them into a dark coloured
substance called humus.
You have learnt about humus in
Chapter 9. In which layer of the soil
would you find humus? What is its
importance to the soil?
The micro-organisms which convert
the dead plants and animals to humus
are known as decomposers. These
micro-organisms play an important role
in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some
dead leaves and discovered under them
a layer of humus on forest floor. The
presence of humus ensures that the
nutrients of the dead plants and
animals are released into the soil. From
there, these nutrients are again absorbed
by the roots of the living plants. “What
happens if an animal dies in the forest?”
Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead
animals become food for vultures, crows,
jackals and insects.” In this way, the
nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes
waste in a forest (Fig. 17.9).

What you have learnt
We get various products from the forests surrounding us.
Forest is a system comprising various plants, animals and
micro-organisms.
In a forest, trees form the uppermost layer, followed by shrubs.
The herbs form the lowest layer of vegetation.
Different layers of vegetation provide food and shelter for animals,
birds and insects.
The various components of the forest are interdependent on one
another.
The forest keeps on growing and changing, and can regenerate.
In the forest, there is interaction between soil, water, air and
living organisms.
Forests protect the soil from erosion.
Soil helps forests to grow and regenerate.
Forests are the lifeline for the forest-dwelling communities.
Forests influence climate, water cycle and air quality.

forest in your area could be cleared for a housing complex. Write a letter
to the department explaining your point of view as a concerned citizen.
2. Visit a forest. Here is a list of points that would make your visit more
fruitful.
(a) Make sure that you have permission to go into the forest.
(b) Make sure that you can find your way around. Get a map and go
along with some one who is familiar with the area.
(c) Keep a record of the things you see and do. Observations make
the visit interesting. Sketches and photographs are useful.
(d) You may record bird calls.
(e) Collect different kinds of seeds or hard fruits like nuts.
(f) Try to recognise various types of trees, shrubs, herbs, etc. Make
lists of plants from different places in the forest and of different
layers. You may not be able to name all the plants, but it is worth
recording and seeing where they grow. Make a record of
approximate heights of plants, crown shape, bark texture, leaf
size, and flower colour.
(g Learn to recognise the animal's droppings.
(h) Interview the forest officials and the people of surrounding vil

Treatment of polluted water
Perform the following activity. It will help
you understand the processes that take
place at the wastewater treatment plant.
Activity 18.4
Divide yourself into groups to perform
the activity. Record observations at each
stage:
• Fill a large glass jar 3/4 full of water.
Add some dirty organic matter such
as grass pieces or orange peels, a
small amount of detergent, and a few
drops of an ink or any colour.
• Cap the jar, shake it well and let the
mixture stand in the sun for two
days.
After two days, shake the mixture
and pour a small sample into test
tube. Label this test tube “Before
treatment; Sample 1”. How does it
smell?
• Use an aerator from an aquarium to
bubble air through the sample in the
glass jar. Allow several hours for
aeration; leave the aerator attached
overnight. If you do not have an
aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or
a mixer. You may have to stir it
several times.
The next day when aeration is
complete, pour another sample into
a second test tube. Label it as “After
aeration; Sample 2”.
Fold a piece of filter paper to form a
cone. Wet the paper with tap water
and then insert the cone in a funnel.
Mount the funnel on a support
(as you have learnt in Class VI).
Place layers of sand, fine gravel and
finally medium gravel in the funnel
(Fig. 18.2). (An actual filtration plant
does not use filter paper, but the sand
filter is several metres deep).
Pour the remaining aerated liquid
through the filter into the beakers.
Do not allow the liquid to spill over
the filter. If the filtered liquid is not
clear, filter it a few times till you get
clear water.
· Pour a sample of the filtered water
into a third test tube labelled
“Filtered; Sample 3”.
. Pour another sample of the filtered
water into a fourth test tube. Add a
small piece of a chlorine tablet. Mix
well until the water is clear. Label the
test tube “Chlorinated; Sample 4"".
222

2. Water then goes to a grit and sand
removal tank. The speed of the
incoming wastewater is decreased to
allow sand, grit and pebbles to settle
down (Fig. 18.4).
. Observe carefully the samples in all
the test tubes. Do not taste! Just
smell them!
Now answer the following questions:
(a) What changes did you observe in the
appearance of the liquid after
aeration?
(b) Did aeration change the odour?
(c) What was removed by the sand filter?
(d) Did chlorine remove the colour?
(e) Did chlorine have an odour? Was it
worse than that of the wastewater?
18.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
(WWTP)
Treatment of wastewater involves
physical, chemical, and biological
processes, which remove physical,
chemical and biological matter that
contaminates the wastewater.
1. Wastewater is passed through bar
screens. Large objects like rags,
sticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins
are removed (Fig. 18.3).
Fig. 18.4 Grit and sand removal tank
3. The water is then allowed to settle in
a large tank which is sloped towards
the middle. Solids like faeces settle
at the bottom and are removed with
a scraper. This is the sludge. A
skimmer removes the floatable solids
like oil and grease. Water so cleared
is called clarified water (Fig. 18.5).
WASTEWATER STORY
223
The activated sludge is about 97%
water. The water is removed by sand
drying beds or machines. Dried sludge
is used as manure, returning organic
matter and nutrients to the soil.
The treated water has a very low level
of organic material and suspended
matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river
or into the ground. Nature cleans it up
further. Sometimes it may be necessary
to disinfect water with chemicals like
chlorine and ozone before releasing it
into the distribution system.

Waste generation is a natural part of
human activity. But we can limit the
type of waste and quantity of waste
produced. Often we have been repelled
by offensive smell. The sight of open
drains is disgusting. The situation
Fig. 18.5 Water clarifer
The sludge is transferred to a
separate tank where it is decomposed
by the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas
produced in the process can be used as
fuel or can be used to produce electricity.
4. Air is pumped into the clarified water
to help aerobic bacteria to grow.
Bacteria consume human waste,
food waste, soaps and other
unwanted matter still remaining in
clarified water (Fig. 18.6).
After several hours, the suspended
microbes settle at the bottom of the tank
as activated sludge. The water is then
removed from the top.
The water in a river is cleaned
naturally by processes that are
similar to those adopted in a
wastewater treatment plant.
Did you know?
It has been suggested that we should
plant eucalyptus trees all along
sewage ponds. These trees absorb all
surplus wastewater rapidly and
release pure water vapour into the
atmosphere.

human excreta is a health hazard. It
may cause water pollution and soil
pollution. Both the surface water and
groundwater get polluted. Groundwater
is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
springs and many rivers as you learnt
in Chapter 16. Thus, it becomes the
most common route for water borne
diseases. They include cholera, typhoid,
polio, meningitis, hepatitis and
dysentery.
18.8 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR
SEWAGE DISPOSAL
To improve sanitation, low cost onsite
sewage disposal systems are being
encouraged. Examples are septic tanks,
chemical toilets, composting pits. Septic
tanks are suitable for places where there
is no sewerage system, for hospitals,
isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5
houses.
Some organisations offer hygienic
on-site human waste disposal
technology. These toilets do not require
scavenging. Excreta from the toilet seat
flow through covered drains into a
biogas plant. The biogas produced is
used as a source of energy.
18.9 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES
In our country fairs are organised
periodically. A large number of people
participate in them. In the same way
railway stations, bus depots, airports,
hospitals are very busy places.
Thousands of people visit them daily.
Large amount of waste is generated
here. It must be disposed of properly
otherwise epidemics could break out.
The government has laid down
certain standards of sanitation but,
unfortunately, they are not strictly
enforced.
However, all of us can contribute in
maintaining sanitation at public places.
We should not scatter litter anywhere.
If there is no dustbin in sight, we should
carry the litter home and throw it in the
dustbin.

Conclusion
We all have a role to play in keeping our
environment clean and healthy. You

maintaining the water sources in a
healthy state. Adopting good sanitation
practices should be our way of life. As

What you have learnt
Used water is wastewater. Wastewater could be reused.
Wastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in
other human activities. This is called sewage.
Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution.
Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.
Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature
can take care of it.
Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are
not available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted.
By-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas.
Open drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organisms
which cause diseases.
We should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal of
excreta by low cost methods.

An early engineering feat: Indus valley civilisation
One of the ancient civilisations, Harappa and Mohenjodaro had perhaps
the world's first urban sanitation system. Within the city individual
houses, or groups of houses, obtained water from wells. There was a
separate room for bathing, and wastewater was directed to the covered
drains which lined the major streets. The oldest toilet made of bricks is
about 4500 years old.

Have you seen farmers spreading
manure or fertilisers in the fields, or
gardeners using them in lawns or in
pots? Do you know why they are added
to the soil?
You learnt that plants absorb
mineral nutrients from the soil. So, their
amounts in the soil keep on declining.
Fertilisers and manures contain plant
nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium,
phosphorous, etc. These nutrients need
to be added from time to time to enrich
the soil. We can grow plants and keep
them healthy if we can find out the
nutrient requirement of plants.
Usually crops require a lot of nitrogen
to make proteins. After the harvest, the
soil becomes deficient in nitrogen.
Though nitrogen gas is available in
plenty in the air, plants cannot use it in
the manner they can use carbon dioxide.
They need nitrogen in a soluble form.
The bacterium called Rhizobium can
take atmospheric nitrogen and convert
it into a soluble form. But Rhizobium
cannot make its own food. So it lives in
the roots of gram, peas, moong beans
and other legumes and provides them
with nitrogen. Most of the pulses (dals)
are obtained from leguminous plants.
In return, the plants provide food and
shelter to the bacteria. They have a

7
symbiotic relationship. This association
is of great significance for the farmers.
They do not need to add nitrogen
fertiliser to the soil in which leguminous
plants are grown.
In this chapter you learnt that
most of the plants are autotrophs.
Only a few plants adopt other modes
of nutrition like parasitic and
saprotrophic. They derive nutrition
from other organisms. All animals
are categorised as heterotrophs since
they depend on plants and other
animals for food. Can we say that
the insectivorous plants are partial
heterotrophs?

What you have learnt
All organisms take food and utilise it to get energy for the growth and
maintenance of their bodies.
Green plants synthesise their food themselves by the process of
photosynthesis. They are autotrophs.
Plants use simple chemical substances like carbon dioxide, water and
minerals for the synthesis of food.
Chlorophyll and sunlight are the essential requirements for
photosynthesis.
Complex chemical substances such as carbohydrates are the products
of photosynthesis.
Solar energy is stored by the leaves with the help of chlorophyll.
Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis.
Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by other living organisms
for their survival.
Fungi derive nutrition from dead, decaying matter. They are saprotrophs.
Plants like cuscuta are parasites. They take food from the host plant.
A few plants and all animals are dependent on others for their nutrition
and are called heterotrophs.

SCIENCE
Nutrition in Animals
You have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot. Animals get their
food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants. Some animals
eat both plants and animals. Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth, repair and functioning
of the body. Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement, mode of intake
of food and its utilisation in the body.
You have studied in Class VI that food
consists of many components. Try to
recall and list them below:
food into simpler substances is called
digestion.
2.1 DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD
The mode of taking food into the body
varies in different organisms. Bees and
humming-birds suck the nectar of
plants, infants of human and many
other animals feed on mother's milk.
Snakes like the python swallow the
animals they prey upon. Some aquatic
animals filter tiny food particles floating
nearby and feed upon them.

2.2 DIGESTION IN HUMANS
We take in food through the mouth,
digest and utilise it. The unused parts
of the food are defecated. Have you ever
wondered what happens to the food
inside the body? The food passes
through a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)
which begins at the buccal cavity and
ends at the anus. The canal can be
divided into various compartments:
(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or
oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small
intestine, (5) large intestine ending in
the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a
very long path? These parts together
form the alimentary canal (digestive
tract). The food components gradually
get digested as food travels through the
various compartments. The inner walls
food into simpler ones. The digestive
tract and the associated glands together
constitute the digestive system.
Now, let us know what happens to
the food in different parts of the digestive
tract.

Sweets and tooth decay
Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria
break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids (see Chapter 5 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually
damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not m
treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, cold drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay.
Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or dantun (C)
and dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between
two teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and
rinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

SCIENCE
Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may get
hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the
windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of
swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel
choked or get hiccups.

and the chest. Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe.
Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards (Fig. 2.7).
At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out. Recall the
instances when you vomited after eating
and think of the reason for it. Discuss
with your parents and teacher.
The stomach
The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its
shape is like a flattened U and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal. It
receives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other.
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices. The mucous protects
the lining of the stomach. The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with the
food and makes the medium in the
stomach acidic. The digestive juices
break down the proteins into simpler
substances.
The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 7.5 metres long. It receives
secretions from the liver and the
pancreas. Besides, its wall also secretes
juices.
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of the
abdomen on the right side. It is the
largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats.
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below the
stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice
acts on carbohydrates and proteins and
changes them into simpler forms. The
The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole
in his stomach. He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properly
(Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as a great opportunity
to see the inside of the stomach through the hole.
He made some wonderful observations.
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning
food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest Fig. 2.8 Alexis St. Martin's
shotgun wound
the food. He also observed that the end of the
stomach opens into the intestine only after the digestion of the food inside the
stomach is completed.

SCIENCE
partly digested food now reaches the
lower part of the small intestine where
the intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food.
The carbohydrates get broken into
simple sugars such as glucose, fats into
fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins
into amino acids.
Absorption in the small
intestine
The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.
This process is called absorption. The
inner walls of the small intestine have
thousands of finger-like outgrowths.
These are called villi (singular villus).
Can you guess what the role of villi could
be in the intestine? The villi increase
the surface area for absorption of the
digested food. Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close to
its surface. The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials. The
absorbed substances are transported
via the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as the
proteins required by the body. This is
called assimilation. In the cells, glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen into
carbon dioxide and water, and energy
is released. The food that remains
undigested and unabsorbed then enters
into the large intestine.
Large intestine
The large intestine is wider and shorter
than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
in length. Its function is to absorb water
and some salts from the undigested food
material. The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there as
semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
time-to-time. This is called egestion.

continuously even when they are not
eating grass? Actually, they quickly
swallow the grass and store it in a
separate part of the stomach called
rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets
Diarrhoea
Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.
This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food
poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.
Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water
with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration
Solution (ORS).

Paheli wants to know why
these animals cannot chew
food properly at the time they
take it in?
Boojho wants to know why
we cannot digest cellulose
like the cattle do.
Ruminants have a large sac-like
structure between the small intestine
and large intestine (Fig. 2.9). The
cellulose of the food is digested here by
the action of certain bacteria which are
not present in humans.
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system. But
there are many small organisms which
do not have a mouth and a digestive
system. Then, how do they acquire and
digest food? In the section below you will
learn another interesting way of food
intake.
2.4 FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN
AMOEBA
Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled
organism found in pond water. Amoeba
has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense
nucleus and many small bubble-like
vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.
Amoeba constantly changes its shape
and position. It pushes out one, or
more finger-like projections, called
pseudopodia or false feet for movement
and capture of food.
Amoeba feeds on some microscopic
organisms. When it senses food, it
partially digested and is called cud. But
later the cud returns to the mouth in
small lumps and the animal chews it.
This process is called rumination and
these animals are called ruminants.
The grass is rich in cellulose, a type
of carbohydrate. Many animals,
including humans, cannot digest
cellulose.

pushes out pseudopodia around the
food particle and engulfs it. The food
becomes trapped in a food vacuole
[Fig. 2.10).
Digestive juices are secreted into the
food vacuole. They act on the food and
break it down into simpler substances
Gradually the digested food is absorbed.
The absorbed substances are used for
growth, maintenance and multiplication.
The undigested residue of the food is
expelled outside by the vacuole.
The basic process of digestion of
food and release of energy is the same
in all animals. In a later chapter you
will learn about the transport of food
absorbed by the intestine to the various
parts of the body.

Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes place in other green parts of the

to synthesise other components of food.
But proteins are nitrogenous substances
which contain nitrogen. From where do
the plants obtain nitrogen?
Recall that nitrogen is present in
abundance in gaseous form in the air.
However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen
in this form. Soil has certain bacteria
that convert gaseous nitrogen into a
usable form and release it into the soil.
These soluble forms are absorbed by the
plants along with water. Also, you might
have seen farmers adding fertilisers rich
in nitrogen to the soil. In this way the
plants fulfil their requirements of
nitrogen along with the other
constituents. Plants can then
synthesise components of food other

Nutrition In Plants,1,Replenishment of Nutrients,How Nutrients are replenished in the Soil,,do_31279774510152089611168_5,"REPLENISHED IN THE SOIL
Have you seen farmers spreading
manure or fertilisers in the fields, or
gardeners using them in lawns or in
pots? Do you know why they are added
to the soil?
You learnt that plants absorb
mineral nutrients from the soil. So, their
amounts in the soil keep on declining.
Fertilisers and manures contain plant
nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium,
phosphorous, etc. These nutrients need
to be added from time to time to enrich
the soil. We can grow plants and keep
them healthy if we can find out the
nutrient requirement of plants.
Usually crops require a lot of nitrogen
to make proteins. After the harvest, the
soil becomes deficient in nitrogen.
Though nitrogen gas is available in
plenty in the air, plants cannot use it in
the manner they can use carbon dioxide.
They need nitrogen in a soluble form.
The bacterium called Rhizobium can
take atmospheric nitrogen and convert
it into a soluble form. But Rhizobium
cannot make its own food. So it lives in
the roots of gram, peas, moong beans
and other legumes and provides them
with nitrogen. Most of the pulses (dals)
are obtained from leguminous plants.
In return, the plants provide food and
shelter to the bacteria. They have a

symbiotic relationship. This association
is of great significance for the farmers.
They do not need to add nitrogen
fertiliser to the soil in which leguminous
plants are grown.
In this chapter you learnt that
most of the plants are autotrophs.
Only a few plants adopt other modes
of nutrition like parasitic and
saprotrophic. They derive nutrition
from other organisms. All animals
are categorised as heterotrophs since
they depend on plants and other
animals for food. Can we say that
the insectivorous plants are partial
heterotrophs?

What you have learnt
All organisms take food and utilise it to get energy for the growth and
maintenance of their bodies.
Green plants synthesise their food themselves by the process of
photosynthesis. They are autotrophs.
Plants use simple chemical substances like carbon dioxide, water and
minerals for the synthesis of food.
Chlorophyll and sunlight are the essential requirements for
photosynthesis.
Complex chemical substances such as carbohydrates are the products
of photosynthesis.
Solar energy is stored by the leaves with the help of chlorophyll.
Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis.
Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by other living organisms
for their survival.
Fungi derive nutrition from dead, decaying matter. They are saprotrophs.
Plants like cuscuta are parasites. They take food from the host plant.
A few plants and all animals are dependent on others for their nutrition
and are called heterotrophs.

Nutrition in Animals
You have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot. Animals get their
food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants. Some animals
eat both plants and animals. Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth, repair and functioning
of the body. Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement, mode of intake
of food and its utilisation in the body.
You have studied in Class VI that food
consists of many components. Try to
recall and list them below:
food into simpler substances is called
digestion.
2.1 DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD
The mode of taking food into the body
varies in different organisms. Bees and
humming-birds suck the nectar of
plants, infants of human and many
other animals feed on mother's milk.
Snakes like the python swallow the
animals they prey upon. Some aquatic
animals filter tiny food particles floating
nearby and feed upon them.

We take in food through the mouth,
digest and utilise it. The unused parts
of the food are defecated. Have you ever
wondered what happens to the food
inside the body? The food passes
through a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)
which begins at the buccal cavity and
ends at the anus. The canal can be
divided into various compartments:
(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or
oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small
intestine, (5) large intestine ending in
the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a
very long path? These parts together
form the alimentary canal (digestive

get digested as food travels through the
various compartments. The inner walls

Sweets and tooth decay
Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria
break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids (see Chapter 5 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually
damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not m
treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, cold drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay.
Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or dantun (C)
and dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between
two teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and
rinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

SCIENCE
Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may get
hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the
windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of
swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel
choked or get hiccups.

and the chest. Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe.
Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards (Fig. 2.7).
At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out. Recall the
instances when you vomited after eating
and think of the reason for it. Discuss
with your parents and teacher.
The stomach
The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its
shape is like a flattened U and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal. It
receives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other.
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices. The mucous protects
the lining of the stomach. The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with the
food and makes the medium in the
stomach acidic. The digestive juices
break down the proteins into simpler
substances.
The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 7.5 metres long. It receives
secretions from the liver and the
pancreas. Besides, its wall also secretes
juices.
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of the
abdomen on the right side. It is the
largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats.
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below the
stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice
acts on carbohydrates and proteins and
changes them into simpler forms. The
The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole
in his stomach. He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properly
(Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as a great opportunity
to see the inside of the stomach through the hole.
He made some wonderful observations.
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning
food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest Fig. 2.8 Alexis St. Martin's
shotgun wound
the food. He also observed that the end of the
stomach opens into the intestine only after the digestion of the food inside the
stomach is completed.
16
SCIENCE
partly digested food now reaches the
lower part of the small intestine where
the intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food.
The carbohydrates get broken into
simple sugars such as glucose, fats into
fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins
into amino acids.
Absorption in the small
intestine
The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.
This process is called absorption. The
inner walls of the small intestine have
thousands of finger-like outgrowths.
These are called villi (singular villus).
Can you guess what the role of villi could
be in the intestine? The villi increase
the surface area for absorption of the
digested food. Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close to
its surface. The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials. The
absorbed substances are transported
via the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as the
proteins required by the body. This is
called assimilation. In the cells, glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen into
carbon dioxide and water, and energy
is released. The food that remains
undigested and unabsorbed then enters
into the large intestine.
Large intestine
The large intestine is wider and shorter
than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
in length. Its function is to absorb water
and some salts from the undigested food
material. The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there as
semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
time-to-time. This is called egestion.

2.3 DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING
ANIMALS
Have you observed cows, buffaloes and
other grass-eating animals chewing
continuously even when they are not
eating grass? Actually, they quickly
swallow the grass and store it in a
separate part of the stomach called
rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets
Diarrhoea
Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.
This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food
poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.
Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water
with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration
Solution (ORS).
NUTRITION IN ANIMALS
17
Paheli wants to know why
these animals cannot chew
food properly at the time they
take it in?
Boojho wants to know why
we cannot digest cellulose
like the cattle do.
Ruminants have a large sac-like
structure between the small intestine
and large intestine (Fig. 2.9). The
cellulose of the food is digested here by
the action of certain bacteria which are
not present in humans.
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system. But
there are many small organisms which
do not have a mouth and a digestive
system. Then, how do they acquire and
digest food? In the section below you will
learn another interesting way of food
intake.
2.4 FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN
AMOEBA
Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled
organism found in pond water. Amoeba
has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense
nucleus and many small bubble-like
vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.
Amoeba constantly changes its shape
and position. It pushes out one, or
more finger-like projections, called
pseudopodia or false feet for movement
and capture of food.
Amoeba feeds on some microscopic
organisms. When it senses food, it
partially digested and is called cud. But
later the cud returns to the mouth in
small lumps and the animal chews it.
This process is called rumination and
these animals are called ruminants.
The grass is rich in cellulose, a type
of carbohydrate. Many animals,
including humans, cannot digest
cellulose.

pushes out pseudopodia around the
food particle and engulfs it. The food
becomes trapped in a food vacuole
[Fig. 2.10).
Digestive juices are secreted into the
food vacuole. They act on the food and
break it down into simpler substances
Gradually the digested food is absorbed.
The absorbed substances are used for
growth, maintenance and multiplication.
The undigested residue of the food is
expelled outside by the vacuole.
The basic process of digestion of
food and release of energy is the same
in all animals. In a later chapter you
will learn about the transport of food
absorbed by the intestine to the various
parts of the body.

PLANTS
There are some plants which do not have
chlorophyll. They cannot synthesise
their food. How do they survive and from
where do they derive nutrition? Like
humans and animals such plants
depend on the food produced by other
plants. They use the heterotrophic
mode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do
you see yellow tubular structures
twining around the stem and branches
of a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta
(Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll.
It takes readymade food from the plant
Fig. 1.4 Leaves of various colours
You often see slimy, green patches
in ponds or in other stagnant water
bodies. These are generally formed by
the growth of organisms called algae.
Can you guess why algae are green in
colour? They contain chlorophyll which
gives them the green colour. Algae can
also prepare their own food by
photosynthesis.
Synthesis of plant food other
than carbohydrates

structure is the modified part of the leaf.
The apex of the leaf forms a lid which
can open and close the mouth of the
pitcher. Inside the pitcher there are hair
which are directed downwards. When
an insect lands in the pitcher, the lid
closes and the trapped insect gets
entangled into the hair. The insect is
digested by the digestive juices secreted
in the pitcher. Such insect-eating plants
are called insectivorous plants.
Is it possible that such plants do not
get all the required nutrients from the
soil in which they grow?
Fig. 1.5 Cuscuta (Amarbel) on host plant
on which it is climbing. The plant on
which it climbs is called a host. Since it
deprives the host of valuable nutrients,
it is called a parasite. Are we and the
other animals also parasites for the
plants? You should think about it and
discuss with your teacher.
Boojho is confused. If the
pitcher plant is green and
carries out photosynthesis, then
why does it feed on insects?
Lid
Paheli wants to know whether
mosquitoes, bed bugs, lice and
leeches that suck our blood are
also parasites.
Have you seen or heard of plants that
can eat animals? There are a few plants
which can trap insects and digest them.
Is it not amazing? Such plants may be
green or of some other colour. Look at

1.4 SAPROTROPHS
You might have seen packets of
mushrooms sold in the vegetable
market. You may have also seen fluffy
umbrella-like patches growing on rotting
wood during the rainy season (Fig. 1.7).
Let us find out what type of nutrients
they need to survive and from where
they get them.

Fig. 1.7 Packet of mushrooms, a mushroom
growing on decayed material
Write down your observations in your
notebook. Most probably you will see
cotton-like threads spread on the piece
of bread.
These organisms are called fungi.
They have a different mode of nutrition.
They secrete digestive juices on the dead
and decaying matter and convert it into
a solution. Then they absorb the
nutrients from it. This mode of nutrition
in which organisms take in nutrients in
solution form from dead and decaying
matter is called saprotrophic nutrition.
Plants which use saprotrophic mode of
nutrition are called saprotrophs.
Fungi also grow on pickles, leather,
clothes and other articles that are left
in hot and humid weather for long time.
Boojho wants to know how
these organisms acquire
nutrients. They do not have
mouths like animals do. They are
not like green plants as they lack
chlorophyll and cannot make food
l by photosynthesis.
Activity 1.2
Take a piece of bread and moisten it with
water. Leave it in a moist warm place
for 2-3 days or until fluffy patches
appear on them (Fig. 1.8). These patches
may be white, green, brown or of any
other colour. Observe the patches under
a microscope or a magnifying glass.
Paheli is keen to know
whether her beautiful shoes,
which she wore on special
occasions, were spoiled by fungi
during the rainy season. She
wants to know how fungi appear
suddenly during the rainy
season.
SCIENCE
s Boojho says once his
grandfather told him that his
wheat fields were spoiled by a
fungus. He wants to know if
fungi cause diseases also.
Paheli told him that many fungi <
like yeast and mushrooms are
useful, but some fungi
cause diseases in plants,
animals and humans.
Some fungi are also used
in medicines.
During the rainy season they spoil many
things. Ask your parents about the
menace of fungi in your house.
The fungal spores are generally
present in the air. When they land on
wet and warm things they germinate
and grow. Now, can you figure out how
we can protect our things from getting
spoiled?
Some organisms live together and
share shelter and nutrients. This is
called symbiotic relationship. For
example, certain fungi live in the roots
of trees. The tree provides nutrients to
the fungus and, in return, receives help
from it to take up water and nutrients
from the soil. This association is very
important for the tree.
In organisms called lichens, a
chlorophyll-containing partner, which is
an alga, and a fungus live together. The
fungus provides shelter, water and
minerals to the alga and, in return, the
alga provides food which it prepares by
photosynthesis.
1.5 How NUTRIENTS ARE
REPLENISHED IN THE SOIL
Have you seen farmers spreading
manure or fertilisers in the fields, or
gardeners using them in lawns or in
pots? Do you know why they are added
to the soil?
You learnt that plants absorb
mineral nutrients from the soil. So, their
amounts in the soil keep on declining.
Fertilisers and manures contain plant
nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium,
phosphorous, etc. These nutrients need
to be added from time to time to enrich
the soil. We can grow plants and keep
them healthy if we can find out the
nutrient requirement of plants.
Usually crops require a lot of nitrogen
to make proteins. After the harvest, the
soil becomes deficient in nitrogen.
Though nitrogen gas is available in
plenty in the air, plants cannot use it in
the manner they can use carbon dioxide.
They need nitrogen in a soluble form.
The bacterium called Rhizobium can
take atmospheric nitrogen and convert
it into a soluble form. But Rhizobium
cannot make its own food. So it lives in
the roots of gram, peas, moong beans
and other legumes and provides them
with nitrogen. Most of the pulses (dals)
are obtained from leguminous plants.
In return, the plants provide food and
shelter to the bacteria. They have a
NUTRITION IN PLANTS
7
symbiotic relationship. This association
is of great significance for the farmers.
They do not need to add nitrogen
fertiliser to the soil in which leguminous
plants are grown.
In this chapter you learnt that
most of the plants are autotrophs.
Only a few plants adopt other modes
of nutrition like parasitic and
saprotrophic. They derive nutrition
from other organisms. All animals
are categorised as heterotrophs since
they depend on plants and other
animals for food. Can we say that
the insectivorous plants are partial
heterotrophs?

What you have learnt
All organisms take food and utilise it to get energy for the growth and
maintenance of their bodies.
Green plants synthesise their food themselves by the process of
photosynthesis. They are autotrophs.
Plants use simple chemical substances like carbon dioxide, water and
minerals for the synthesis of food.
Chlorophyll and sunlight are the essential requirements for
photosynthesis.
Complex chemical substances such as carbohydrates are the products
of photosynthesis.
Solar energy is stored by the leaves with the help of chlorophyll.
Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis.
Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by other living organisms
for their survival.
Fungi derive nutrition from dead, decaying matter. They are saprotrophs.
Plants like cuscuta are parasites. They take food from the host plant.
A few plants and all animals are dependent on others for their nutrition
and are called heterotrophs.

Nutrition in Animals
You have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot. Animals get their
food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants. Some animals
eat both plants and animals. Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth, repair and functioning
of the body. Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement, mode of intake
of food and its utilisation in the body.
You have studied in Class VI that food
consists of many components. Try to
recall and list them below:
food into simpler substances is called
digestion.
2.1 DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD
The mode of taking food into the body
varies in different organisms. Bees and
humming-birds suck the nectar of
plants, infants of human and many
other animals feed on mother's milk.
Snakes like the python swallow the
animals they prey upon. Some aquatic

We take in food through the mouth,
digest and utilise it. The unused parts
of the food are defecated. Have you ever
wondered what happens to the food
inside the body? The food passes
through a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)
which begins at the buccal cavity and
ends at the anus. The canal can be
divided into various compartments:
(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or
oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small
intestine, (5) large intestine ending in
the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a
very long path? These parts together
form the alimentary canal (digestive
tract). The food components gradually
get digested as food travels through the
various compartments. The inner walls

tract and the associated glands together

Take two test tubes. Label them ‘A’and
‘B’. In test tube ‘A’ put one teaspoonful
of boiled rice; in test tube 'B' keep one
teaspoonful of boiled rice after chewing
it for 3 to 5 minutes. Add 3-4 mL of
water in both the test tubes (Fig. 2.4).
Now pour 2-3 drops of iodine solution
in each test tube and observe. Why is
there a change in colour in the test
tubes? Discuss the results with your

Sweets and tooth decay
Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria
break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids (see Chapter 5 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually
damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not m
treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, cold drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay.
Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or dantun (C)
and dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between
two teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and
rinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

SCIENCE
Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may get
hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the
windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of
swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel
choked or get hiccups.

and the chest. Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe.
Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards (Fig. 2.7).
At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out. Recall the
instances when you vomited after eating
and think of the reason for it. Discuss
with your parents and teacher.
The stomach
The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its
shape is like a flattened U and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal. It
receives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other.
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices. The mucous protects
the lining of the stomach. The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with the
food and makes the medium in the
stomach acidic. The digestive juices
break down the proteins into simpler
substances.
The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 7.5 metres long. It receives
secretions from the liver and the
pancreas. Besides, its wall also secretes
juices.
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of the
abdomen on the right side. It is the
largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats.
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below the
stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice
acts on carbohydrates and proteins and
changes them into simpler forms. The
The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole
in his stomach. He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properly
(Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as a great opportunity
to see the inside of the stomach through the hole.
He made some wonderful observations.
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning
food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest Fig. 2.8 Alexis St. Martin's
shotgun wound
the food. He also observed that the end of the
stomach opens into the intestine only after the digestion of the food inside the
stomach is completed.
16
SCIENCE
partly digested food now reaches the
lower part of the small intestine where
the intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food.
The carbohydrates get broken into
simple sugars such as glucose, fats into
fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins
into amino acids.
Absorption in the small
intestine
The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.
This process is called absorption. The
inner walls of the small intestine have
thousands of finger-like outgrowths.
These are called villi (singular villus).
Can you guess what the role of villi could
be in the intestine? The villi increase
the surface area for absorption of the
digested food. Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close to
its surface. The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials. The
absorbed substances are transported
via the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as the
proteins required by the body. This is
called assimilation. In the cells, glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen into
carbon dioxide and water, and energy
is released. The food that remains
undigested and unabsorbed then enters
into the large intestine.
Large intestine
The large intestine is wider and shorter
than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
in length. Its function is to absorb water
and some salts from the undigested food
material. The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there as
semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
time-to-time. This is called egestion.

2.3 DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING
ANIMALS
Have you observed cows, buffaloes and
other grass-eating animals chewing
continuously even when they are not
eating grass? Actually, they quickly
swallow the grass and store it in a
separate part of the stomach called
rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets
Diarrhoea
Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.
This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food
poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.
Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water
with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration
Solution (ORS).

Paheli wants to know why
these animals cannot chew
food properly at the time they
take it in?
Boojho wants to know why
we cannot digest cellulose
like the cattle do.
Ruminants have a large sac-like
structure between the small intestine
and large intestine (Fig. 2.9). The
cellulose of the food is digested here by
the action of certain bacteria which are
not present in humans.
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system. But
there are many small organisms which
do not have a mouth and a digestive
system. Then, how do they acquire and
digest food? In the section below you will
learn another interesting way of food
intake.
2.4 FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN
AMOEBA
Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled
organism found in pond water. Amoeba
has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense
nucleus and many small bubble-like
vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.
Amoeba constantly changes its shape
and position. It pushes out one, or
more finger-like projections, called
pseudopodia or false feet for movement
and capture of food.
Amoeba feeds on some microscopic
organisms. When it senses food, it
partially digested and is called cud. But
later the cud returns to the mouth in
small lumps and the animal chews it.
This process is called rumination and
these animals are called ruminants.
The grass is rich in cellulose, a type
of carbohydrate. Many animals,
including humans, cannot digest
cellulose.

pushes out pseudopodia around the
food particle and engulfs it. The food
becomes trapped in a food vacuole
[Fig. 2.10).
Digestive juices are secreted into the
food vacuole. They act on the food and
break it down into simpler substances
Gradually the digested food is absorbed.
The absorbed substances are used for
growth, maintenance and multiplication.
The undigested residue of the food is
expelled outside by the vacuole.
The basic process of digestion of
food and release of energy is the same
in all animals. In a later chapter you
will learn about the transport of food
absorbed by the intestine to the various
parts of the body.

What you have learnt
Animal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food
and its utilisation in the body.
The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and
secretory glands. It consists of the (i) buccal cavity, (ii) oesophagus,
(iii) stomach, (iv) small intestine, (v) large intestine ending in rectum
and (vi) anus. The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juices
are (i) the salivary glands, (ii) the liver and (iii) the pancreas. The stomach
wall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices.
The modes of feeding vary in different organisms.
Digestion is a complex process involving: (i) ingestion, (ii) digestion,
(iii) absorption, (iv) assimilation and (v) egestion.
NUTRITION IN ANIMALS
19
Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The
digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from the
liver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juice from
the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of food in
the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vessels in
the small intestine.
The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body.
Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in the
large intestine.
The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the body
as faeces through the anus.
The grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known as
ruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it in
the rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews
it peacefully.
Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia.
The food is digested in the food vacuole.

Fibre to Fabric
n Class VI you have learnt about
some fibres obtained from plants.
You also learnt that wool and silk
fibres are obtained from animals. Wool
is obtained from the fleece (hair) of
sheep or yak. Silk fibres come from
Cocoons of the silk moth. Do you know
which part of the sheep's body yields
fibres? Are you aware how these fibres
are converted into the woollen yarn that
we buy from the market to knit sweaters?
Do you have any idea how silk fibres are
made into silk, which is woven into saris?
In this Chapter we shall try to find
answers to these questions.
Animal fibres – wool and silk
Like us, the hairy skin of the sheep
has two types of fibres that form its
fleece: (i) the coarse beard hair, and
(ii) the fine soft under-hair close to the
skin. The fine hair provide the fibres for
making wool. Some breeds of sheep
possess only fine under-hair. Their
parents are specially chosen to give birth
to sheep which have only soft under-
hair. This process of selecting parents
for obtaining special characters in their
offspring, such as soft under hair in
sheep, is termed 'selective breeding'.
3.1 WOOL
Wool comes from sheep, goat, yak and
some other animals. These wool-yielding
animals bear hair on their body. Do you
know why these animals have a thick
coat of hair? Hair trap a lot of air. Air is
a poor conductor of heat, as you would
learn in Chapter 4. So, hair keeps these
animals warm. Wool is derived from
these hairy fibres.

From fibres to wool
For obtaining wool, sheep are reared.
Their hair is cut and processed into
wool. Let us learn about this process.
Rearing and breeding of sheep: If you
travel to the hills in Jammu & Kashmir,
Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal,
Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, or the
plains of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan
and Gujarat, you can see shepherds
taking their herds of sheep for grazing.
Sheep are herbivores and prefer grass
and leaves. Apart from grazing sheep,
rearers also feed them on a mixture of
pulses, corn, jowar, oil cakes (material
left after taking out oil from seeds) and
minerals. In winter, sheep are kept
indoors and fed on leaves, grain and dry
fodder.
Sheep are reared in many parts of
our country for wool. Table 3.1 gives the
names of some breeds of sheep reared
in our country for producing wool. The
quality and texture of the fibres obtained
from them is also indicated in the table.
Certain breeds of sheep have thick
coat of hair on their body which yields
good quality wool in large quantities. As
mentioned earlier, these sheep are
""selectively bred” with one parent being
a sheep of good breed.
Once the reared sheep have
developed a thick growth of hair, hair is
shaved off for getting wool.
Processing fibres into wool
The wool which is used for knitting
sweaters or for weaving shawls is the
finished product of a long process,
which involves the following steps:
Step I: The fleece of the sheep along with a
thin layer of skin is removed from its
body (Fig. 3.8 (a)]. This process is called
shearing. Machines similar to those used
by barbers are used to shave off hair.
Usually, hair are removed during the hot
weather. This enables sheep to survive
without their protective coat of hair. The
hair provide woollen fibres. Woollen
fibres are then processed to obtain
woollen yarn. Shearing does not hurt
the sheep just as it does not hurt when
you get a hair cut or your father shaves his
beard. Do you know why? The uppermost
layer of the skin is dead. Also, the hair of
sheep grow again just as your hair does.

Step II: The sheared skin with hair is
thoroughly washed in tanks to remove
grease, dust and dirt. This is called
scouring. Nowadays scouring is done
by machines (Fig. 3.8 (b) and (c)].
Step III: After scouring, sorting is done.
The hairy skin is sent to a factory where
hair of different textures are separated
or sorted.
Step IV: The small fluffy fibres, called
burrs, are picked out from the hair.
These are the same burrs which
sometimes appear on your sweaters. The
fibres are scoured again and dried. This
is the wool ready to be drawn into fibres.

Step V: The fibres can be dyed in various
colours, as the natural fleece of sheep

made into wool for sweaters and the
shorter fibres are spun and woven
into woollen cloth.

which hatch larvae which are called
caterpillars or silkworms. They grow in
size and when the caterpillar is ready to

carefully on strips of cloth or paper and
sold to silkworm farmers. The farmers

temperature and humidity.
The eggs are warmed to a suitable
temperature for the larvae to hatch from
eggs. This is done when mulberry trees

Discovery of silk
The exact time of discovery of silk is perhaps unknown. According to an old
Chinese legend, the empress Si-lung-Chi was asked by the emperor Huang-ti to
find the cause of the damaged leaves of mulberry trees growing in their garden.
The empress found white worms eating up mulberry leaves. She also noticed
that they were spinning shiny cocoons around them. Accidentally a cocoon
dropped into her cup of tea and a tangle of delicate threads separated from the
cocoon. Silk industry began in China and was kept a closely guarded secret for
hundreds of years. Later on, traders and travellers introduced silk to other
countries. The route they travelled is still called the ‘silk route'.

attached. The caterpillar or silkworm
spins the cocoon inside which develops
the silk moth.
Processing silk: A pile of cocoons is
used for obtaining silk fibres. The
cocoons are kept under the sun or boiled
or exposed to steam. The silk fibres
separate out. The process of taking out
threads from the cocoon for use as silk
is called reeling the silk. Reeling is done
in special machines, which unwind
the threads or fibres of silk from the
cocoon. Silk fibres are then spun into
silk threads, which are woven into silk
cloth by weavers.

What you have learnt
Silk comes from silkworms and wool from sheep, goat and yak. Hence
silk and wool are animal fibres.
The hairs of camel, llama and alpaca are also processed to yield wool.
In India, mostly sheep are reared for getting wool.
Sheep hair is sheared off from the body, scoured, sorted, dried, dyed,
spun and woven to yield wool.
Silkworms are caterpillars of silk moth.
During their life cycle, the worms spin cocoons of silk fibres.
Silk fibres are made of a protein.
Silk fibres from cocoons are taken out and reeled into silk threads.
Weavers weave silk threads into silk cloth.

is transferred from the pan to the
surroundings. So you can understand
that in both cases, the heat flows from

flame and one hand on the side of the
flame (Fig. 4.10). Do your hands feel
equally hot? If not which hand feels
hotter? And why?
Notice that towards the top, the air
gets heated by convection. Therefore, the
hand above the flame feels hot. On the
sides, however, there is no convection
and air does not feel as hot as at
the top.
The people living in the coastal areas
experience an interesting phenomenon.
During the day, the land gets heated
faster than the water. The air over the
land becomes hotter and rises up. The
cooler air from the sea rushes in towards
the land to take its place. The warm air
from the land moves towards the sea to
complete the cycle. The air from the sea
is called the sea breeze. To receive the
cooler sea breeze, the windows of the
houses in coastal areas are made to face
the sea. At night it is exactly the reverse
(Fig. 4.11). The water cools down more
slowly than the land. So, the cool air
from the land moves towards the sea.
This is called the land breeze. Fig. 4.11
shows this phenomenon.
When we come out in the sun, we
feel warm. How does the heat from the
sun reach us? It cannot reach us by

What you have learnt
Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness
of an object.
Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.
Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperatures.
Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature. The
range of this thermometer is from 35°C to 42°С. For other purposes, we
use the laboratory thermometers. The range of these thermometers is
usually from -10°C to 110°C.
The normal temperature of the human body is 37°C.
The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower
temperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from one
object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.
In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids
and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required
for transfer of heat by radiation.
The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are
conductors of heat.
The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are
called insulators.
Dark-coloured objects absorb radiation better than the light-coloured
objects. That is the reason we feel more comfortable in light-coloured
clothes in the summer.
Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is a
poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres.

the result in Table 5.1.
CAUTION
1. Do not taste anything unless asked
to do so.
2. Do not touch anything unless asked
to do so.
Table 5.1
You find that some of these
substances taste sour, some taste bitter,
some taste sweet and some taste salty.
5.1 ACIDS AND BASES
Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and
vinegar taste sour. These substances
taste sour because they contain acids.
The chemical nature of such
substances is acidic. The word acid
comes from the Latin word acere which
means sour. The acids in these
substances are natural acids.
What about baking soda? Does it also
taste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since,
it does not taste sour it means, that it
has no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If
you rub its solution between fingers, it
feels soapy. Substances like these which
are bitter in taste and feel soapy on
touching are known as bases. The nature
of such substances is said to be basic.
If we cannot taste every substance,
how do we find its nature?
Special type of substances are used
to test whether a substance is acidic or
basic. These substances are known as
indicators. The indicators change their
colour when added to a solution
containing an acidic or a basic
substance. Turmeric, litmus, china rose
petals (Gudhal), etc., are some of the
naturally occurring indicators.

water. When added to an acidic
solution, it turns red and when
added to a basic solution, it turns
blue. It is available in the form of a

Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damaging
effect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is
called an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic
because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released
into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric
acid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,
historical monuments, plants and animals.
CAUTION
Great care should be taken while
handling laboratory acids and bases
because these are corrosive in nature,
irritating and harmful to skin.
Demonstrate the effect of the three
indicators on each of these solutions.
Record your observations in Table 5.5.
5.3 NEUTRALISATION
We have learnt that acids turn blue
litmus red and bases turn red litmus
blue. Let us see what happens when an
acid is mixed with a base.
We are going to use an indicator you
have not used so far. It is called
phenolphthalein.
Activity 5.5
To be demonstrated by the teacher in
the class
Fill one fourth of a test tube with dilute
hydrochloric acid. Note down its colour.
Note down the colour of phenolphthalein
solution also. Add 2–3 drops of the
indicator to the acid. Now shake the test
tube gently. Do you observe any change
in colour of the acid?
Add to the acidic solution a drop of
sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.
Stir the tube gently. Is there any change
in the colour of the solution? Continue
adding the sodium hydroxide solution
drop by drop while stirring till the pink
colour just appears.
Now add one more drop of dilute
hydrochloric acid. What do you observe?
The solution again becomes colourless.
Again add one drop of sodium
hydroxide solution. Is there any change
in colour? The solution again becomes
pink in colour.
It is evident that when the solution
is basic, phenolphthalein gives a pink
colour. On the other hand, when the
solution is acidic, it remains colourless.

_Acid + Indicator
Fig. 5.4 Process of neutralisation
54
SCIENCE
When an acidic solution is mixed
with a basic solution, both the solutions
neutralise the effect of each other. When
an acid solution and a base solution are
mixed in suitable amounts, both the
acidic nature of the acid and the basic
nature of the base are destroyed. The
resulting solution is neither acidic nor
basic. Touch the test tube immediately
after neutralisation. What do you
observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat
is always produced, or evolved. The
evolved heat raises the temperature of
the reaction mixture.
In neutralisation reaction a new
substance is formed. This is called salt.
Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral in
nature. Thus, neutralisation can be
defined as follows:
The reaction between an acid and
Salt+Water
a base is known as neutralisation. Salt
and water are produced in this process
with the evolution of heat.
Acid+Base Salt+Water
(Heat is evolved)
The following reaction is an example:

LIFE
have learnt in Chapter 2. But too
much of acid in the stomach causes
indigestion. Sometimes indigestion
is painful. To relieve indigestion, we
take an antacid such as milk of
magnesia, which contains magnesium
hydroxide. It neutralises the effect of
excessive acid.
Ant sting
The sting of an ant contains formic
acid. When an ant bites, it injects
the acidic liquid into the skin. The
effect of the sting can be neutralised by
rubbing moist baking soda (sodium
hydrogen carbonate) or calamine
solution, which contains zinc
carbonate.
Soil treatment
Excessive use of chemical fertilisers
makes the soil acidic. Plants do not grow
well when the soil is either too acidic or
too basic. When the soil is too acidic, it
is treated with bases like quick lime
(calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium
hydroxide). If the soil is basic, organic
matter is added to it. Organic matter
releases acids which neutralises the
basic nature of the soil.
Factory wastes
The wastes of many factories
contain acids. If they are allowed to
flow into the water bodies, the acids
will kill fish and other organisms.
The factory wastes are, therefore,
neutralised by adding basic
substances.

What you have learnt
Acids are sour in taste. Bases are bitter in taste and soapy to touch.
Acid turns blue litmus red. Bases turn red litmus blue.
Substances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral.
Solutions of substances that show different colour in acidic, basic and
neutral solutions are called indicators.
An acid and a base neutralise each other and form a salt. A salt may be
acidic, basic or neutral in nature.

Physical and Chemical
Changes
A very day you come across many
changes in your surroundings.
These changes may involve one
or more substances. For example, your
mother may ask you to dissolve sugar
in water to make a cold drink. Making a
sugar solution is a change. Similarly,
setting curd from milk is a change.
Sometimes milk becomes sour. Souring
of milk is a change. Stretched rubber
band also represents a change.
Make a list of ten changes you have
noticed around you.
In this chapter we shall perform some
activities and study the nature of these
changes. Broadly, these changes are of
two kinds, physical and chemical.
6.1 PHYSICAL CHANGES
Activity 6.1
Cut a piece of paper in four square
pieces. Cut each square piece further
into four square pieces. Lay these pieces
on the floor or a table so that the pieces
acquire the shape of the original piece
of paper (Fig. 6.1).
Obviously, you cannot join the pieces
back to make the original piece, but is
there a change in the property of the
paper?
Activity 6.2
Collect the chalk dust lying on the floor
near the blackboard in your classroom.
Or, crush a small piece of chalk into
dust. Add a little water to the dust to
make a paste. Roll it into the shape of a
piece of chalk. Let it dry.
Did you recover chalk from the
dust?
Activity 6.3
Take some ice in a glass or plastic
tumbler. Melt a small portion of ice by
placing the tumbler in the sun. You have
now a mixture of ice and water. Now
place the tumbler in a freezing mixture
(ice plus common salt).
Does the water become solid ice once
again?
Fig. 6.1 Paper pieces
Activity 6.4
Boil some water in a container. Do you
see the steam rising from the surface of
water? Hold an inverted pan by its
handle over the steam at some distance
from the boiling water. Observe the
inner surface of the pan.
Do you see any droplet of water
there?
Activity 6.5
CAUTION
Be careful while handling a flame.
Hold a used hack-saw blade with a
pair of tongs. Keep the tip of the free
end on the flame of a gas stove. Wait for
a few minutes.
Does the colour of the tip of the blade
change?
Remove the blade from the flame.
Observe the tip once again after some
time.
Does it get back its original colour?
In Activities 6.1 and 6.2 above, you
saw that paper and a piece of chalk
underwent changes in size. In Activities
6.3 and 6.4, water changed its state (from
solid to liquid, or from gas to liquid). In
Activity 6.5, the hack-saw blade
changed colour on heating.
Properties such as shape, size, colour
and state of a substance are called its
physical properties. A change in which
a substance undergoes a change in its
physical properties is called a physical
change. A physical change is generally
reversible. In such a change no new
substance is formed.
Let us now consider the other kind
of change.
6.2 CHEMICAL CHANGE
A change with which you are quite
familiar is the rusting of iron. If you
leave a piece of iron in the open for some
time, it acquires a film of brownish
substance. This substance is called rust
and the process is called rusting
(Fig. 6.2). Iron gates of parks or
farmlands, iron benches kept in lawns
and gardens, almost every article of iron,
kept in the open gets rusted. At home
you must have seen shovels and spades

atmosphere for some time. In the
kitchen, a wet iron pan (tawa) often gets
rusted if left in that state for some time.
Rust is not iron. It is different from iron
on which it gets deposited.
Let us consider a few more changes
where new substances are formed.

magnesium ribbon?

the following equation:
Magnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (0) ►
Magnesium oxide (Mgo)

those in mathematics. In equations
of this kind, the arrow implies
'becomes’. No attempt should be made
to balance chemical equations at this
stage.

On the basis of this test, how do you
classify the aqueous solution — acidic
or basic?
On dissolving the ash in water it
forms a new substance. This change can
be written in the form of the following
equation:
Magnesium oxide (MgO) + Water
(H,O) → Magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)]
As you have already learnt in
Chapter 5, magnesium hydroxide is a base.
So, magnesium oxide is a new substance
formed on burning of magnesium.
Magnesium hydroxide is another new

substance formed by mixing magnesium
oxide with water.
Activity 6.7
(To be demonstrated by the teacher)
Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper
sulphate (blue vitriol or neela thotha) in
about half a cup of water in a glass
tumbler or a beaker. Add a few drops of
dilute sulphuric acid to the solution.
You should get a blue coloured solution.
Save a small sample of the solution in a
test tube or a small glass bottle. Drop a
nail or a used shaving blade into the
remaining solution. Wait for half an
hour or so. Observe the colour of the
solution. Compare it with the colour of
the sample solution saved separately
(Fig. 6.4).
colour of the solution from blue to
green is due to the formation of iron
sulphate, a new substance. The brown
deposit on the iron nail is copper,
another new substance. We can write
the reaction as:
Copper Sulphate solution (blue) + Iron
→ Iron Sulphate solution (green)
+ Copper (brown deposit)
Activity 6.8
Take about a teaspoonful of vinegar in
a test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda

Carbon dioxide (CO,) + Lime water

When carbon dioxide is passed
through lime water, calcium carbonate
is formed, which makes lime water milky.
The turning of lime water into milky is a
standard test of carbon dioxide. You will
use it in Chapter 10 to show that the air
we breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide.
In Activities 6.6-6.8, you saw that
in each change one or more new
substances were formed. In Activity 6.6,
the ash was the new substance formed
when magnesium was burnt. In Activity 6.7,
the reaction of copper sulphate with iron
produced iron sulphate and copper.
Both of these are new substances.
Copper was deposited on the shaving
blade of iron. In Activity 6.8, vinegar and
baking soda together produced carbon
dioxide, which turned lime water milky.
Can you name the new substance
formed in this reaction?
A change in which one or more
new substances are formed is called a
chemical change. A chemical change
is also called a chemical reaction.
Chemical changes are very important
in our lives. All new substances are
formed as a result of chemical changes.
For example, if a metal is to be extracted
from an ore, such as iron from iron ore,
we need to carry out a series of chemical
changes. A medicine is the end product
of a chain of chemical reactions. Useful
new materials, such as plastics and
detergents, are produced by chemical
reactions. Indeed, every new material
is discovered by studying chemical
changes.
We have seen that one or more new
substances are produce in a chemical
change. In addition to new products,
the following may accompany a chemical
change:
Heat, light or any other radiation
(ultraviolet, for example) may be given
off or absorbed.
Sound may be produced.
A change in smell may take place or
a new smell may be given off.
• A colour change may take place .
• A gas may be formed.
Let us look at some examples.
You saw that burning of magnesium
ribbon is a chemical change. Burning
of coal, wood or leaves is also a chemical
change. In fact, burning of any
substance is a chemical change.
Burning is always accompanied by
production of heat.

I wonder who prepares
these reports!
o you remember the things that
you were asked to pack when
you were heading for a hill
station? When the sky is cloudy, your
parents insist that you carry an
umbrella. Have you heard elders in your
family discuss the weather before
planning a family function? You must
have also heard the experts discussing
the weather before the start of a game.
Have you ever wondered why? The
weather may have a profound effect on
the game. It has a profound effect on
our lives. Many of our daily activities are
planned based on the weather predicted
for that day. There are daily reports of
the weather on the television and
radio and in the newspapers. But do you
know what this weather really is?
In this chapter, we will study about
the weather and climate. We will also
see how different forms of life are
adapted to the climate of their habitat.
7.1 WEATHER
In Fig. 7.1 a sample of weather report
from a newspaper is given.
We find that the daily weather report
carries information about the
temperature, humidity and rainfall
during the past 24 hours. It also
predicts the weather for the day.
Humidity, as you might know, is a
measure of the moisture in air.
| The weather reports are prepared by
the Meteorological Department of the
Government. This department collects
data on temperature, wind, etc., and
makes the weather prediction.
Activity 7.1
Cut out the weather reports of the last
week from any newspaper. If you do not
get a newspaper at home borrow from
your neighbours or friends and copy
these reports in your notebook. You can
also collect weather reports from a
library. Paste all the cut-outs on a white
sheet or on a chart paper.
Now record the information from the
weather reports collected by you in
Table 7.1. The first row is just a sample.
Fill all the columns according to the data
in the chart that you have prepared.

*(Rainfall may not be recorded for all the days since it may not rain everyday. Leave
the space for rainfall blank if the data is not available.)
Rainfall is measured by an
instrument called the rain gauge. It
is basically a measuring cylinder with
a funnel on top to collect rainwater
Do all the seven days have the same
maximum and minimum temperatures,
humidity and rainfall? The maximum
and minimum temperatures recorded
may be the same for some of the days.
However, all the parameters are not the
same on any two days. Over a week there
may be considerable variation. The day-
to-day condition of the atmosphere
at a place with respect to the
temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-
speed, etc., is called the weather at that
place. The temperature, humidity, and
other factors are called the elements of
the weather. The weather of a place
changes day after day and week after
week. That is why we often say, “today's
weather is too humid"", or ""the weather
was warm last week”.
The weather is such a complex
phenomenon that it can vary over very
short periods of time. It can happen
sometimes that it is sunny in the
morning, but suddenly clouds appear
from nowhere and it starts raining
heavily. Or, a heavy rain may vanish in
a matter of minutes and give way to
bright sunshine. You must have had
several such experiences. Try to recall
any such experience and share it with
your friends. Since weather is such a
complex phenomenon, it is not easy to
predict.
Look at the graph given below which
shows the maximum temperature
recorded during 03 August 2006 to 09

As it is clear from any weather report
the maximum and minimum
temperatures are recorded every day. Do
you know how these temperatures are
recorded. In Chapter 4 you have learnt
that there are special thermometers for
this purpose, called maximum and
minimum thermometers. Can you
guess when during the day we have the
maximum temperature and when the
minimum?
The maximum temperature of the day
occurs generally in the afternoon while
the minimum temperature occurs
generally in the early morning. Can you
now understand why in summers we feel
so miserable in the afternoon and
comparatively comfortable early in the
morning?
I wonder why weather
changes so frequently!
What is the source of weather
7 in the first place?
All changes in the weather are caused by the sun. The sun is a huge sphere of
hot gases at a very high temperature. The distance of the sun from us is very
large. Even then the energy sent out by the sun is so huge that it is the source of
all heat and light on the earth. So, the sun is the primary source of energy that
causes changes in the weather. Energy absorbed and reflected by the earth's
surface, oceans and the atmosphere play important roles in determining the
weather at any place. If you live near the sea, you would have realised that the
weather at your place is different from that of a place in a desert, or near a mountain.
70
SCIENCE
What about the times of sunrise and
sunset? You know that in winters it
becomes dark early and you do not get
much time to play. Are the days shorter
in winter than in summer? Try to find
it out yourself by completing the project
given at the end of the chapter.
7.2 CLIMATE
Meteorologists record the weather every
day. The records of the weather have
been preserved for the past several
decades. These help us to determine the
weather pattern at a place. The average
weather pattern taken over a long
time, say 25 years, is called the
climate of the place. If we find that
the temperature at a place is high most
of the time, then we say that the climate
of that place is hot. If there is also heavy
rainfall on most of the days in the same
place, then we can say that the climate
of that place is hot and wet.
In Table 7.2 and 7.3, we have given
the climatic condition at two places in
India. The mean temperature for a given
month is found in two steps. First we
find the average of the temperatures
recorded during the month. Second, we
calculate the average of such average
temperatures over many years. That
gives the mean temperature. The two
places are: Srinagar in Jammu and
Kashmir, and Thiruvananthapuram in
Kerala.

WEATHER, CLIMATE AND ADAPTATIONS OF ANIMALS TO CLIMATE
71
By looking at Tables 7.2 and 7.3 we
can easily see the difference in the
climate of Jammu & Kashmir and
Kerala. We can see that Kerala is very
hot and wet in comparison to Jammu
& Kashmir, which has a moderately hot
and wet climate for a part of the year.
Similar data for the western region
of India, for example Rajasthan, will
show that the temperature is high
during most part of the year. But during
winter, which lasts only for a few
months, the temperature is quite low.
This region receives very little
rainfall. This is the typical desert
climate. It is hot and dry. The north-
eastern India receives rain for a major
part of the year. Therefore, we can say
that the climate of the north-east is wet.
7.3 CLIMATE AND ADAPTATION
Climate has a profound effect on all
living organisms.
Animals are adapted to survive in the
conditions in which they live. Animals
living in very cold and hot climate must
possess special features to protect
themselves against the extreme cold or
heat. Recall from Chapter 9 of your
Class VI science book the definition of
adaptation. Features and habits that
help animals to adapt to their
surroundings are a result of the process
of evolution.
In Chapter 9 you will learn about the
effect of weather and climate on soil.
Here we study the effect of climate on
animals only. In Class VI, you have read
about adaptations of animals to certain
habitats. As examples of adaptation of
animals to climatic conditions, we
discuss only animals living in polar
regions and tropical rainforests.
As the name suggests, the polar
regions are situated near the poles, i.e.,
north pole and south pole.
Some well-known countries that
belong to the polar regions are Canada,
Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Alaska in U.S.A. and Siberian
region of Russia.
Examples of some countries where
the tropical rainforests are found are
India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil,
Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and
Nigeria.
Activity 7.2
Take an outline map of the world. Mark
the polar regions in blue. Similarly,
mark the tropical regions in red.
(i) The polar regions
The polar regions present an extreme
climate. These regions are covered with
snow and it is very cold for most part of
the year. For six months the sun does
not set at the poles while for the other
six months the sun does not rise. In
winters, the temperature can be as low
as -37°C. Animals living there have
adapted to these severe conditions. Let
us see how they are adapted by
considering the examples of polar bears
and penguins.
Polar bears have white fur so that
they are not easily visible in the snowy
white background. It protects them from
72
SCIENCE
Another well-known animal living in
the polar regions is the penguin
(Fig. 7.4). It is also white and merges
well with the white background. It also
has a thick skin and a lot of fat to protect
it from cold. You may have seen pictures
of penguins huddled together. This they
do to keep warm. Recall how warm you
feel when you are in a hall full of people.
their predators. It also helps them in
catching their prey. To protect them
from extreme cold, they have two thick
layers of fur. They also have a layer of
fat under their skin. In fact, they are so
well-insulated that they have to move
slowly and rest often to avoid getting
overheated.
Physical activities on warm days
necessitate cooling. So, the polar bear
goes for swimming. It is a good
swimmer. Its paws are wide and large,
which help it not only to swim well but
also walk with ease in the snow. While
swimming under water, it can close its
nostrils and can remain under water for
long durations. It has a strong sense of
smell so that it can catch its prey
for food. We can understand the
adaptations of polar bears with the help
of the flow chart shown in Fig. 7.3.

long, birds must remain warm to
survive. They migrate to warmer regions
when winter sets in. They come back
after the winter is over. You know
probably that India is one of the
destinations of many of these birds. You
must have seen or heard about the
Siberian crane that comes from Siberia
to places like Bharatpur in Rajasthan
and Sultanpur in Haryana, and some
Fig. 7.5 Feet of penguin
Like polar bears, penguins are also good
swimmers. Their bodies are streamlined
and their feet have webs, making them
good swimmers (Fig. 7.5).
Other animals living in the polar
regions are many types of fishes, musk
oxen, reindeers, foxes, seals, whales,
and birds. It is to be noted that while
fish can remain under cold water for
Do fishes and butterflies
also migrate like birds?
Fig. 7.6 Migratory birds

birds in flight
Did you know?
Some migratory birds travel as much as 15000 km to escape the extreme climatic
conditions at home. Generally they fly high where the wind flow is helpful and
the cold conditions allow them to disperse the heat generated by their flight
muscles. But how these birds travel to the same place year after year is still a
mystery. It seems that these birds have a built-in sense of direction and know in
which direction to travel. Some birds probably use landmarks to guide them. Many
birds may be guided by the sun during the day and stars at night. There is some
evidence that birds may use the magnetic field of the earth to find direction. And
it is not only birds that migrate; mammals, many types of fish and insects are
also known to migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates.

wetlands of north east and some other
parts of India (Fig. 7.6).
(ii) The tropical rainforests
The tropical region has generally a hot
climate because of its location around
the equator. Even in the coldest month
the temperature is generally higher than
about 15°C. During hot summers, the
temperature may cross 40°C. Days and
nights are almost equal in length
throughout the year. These regions get
plenty of rainfall. An important feature
of this region is the tropical rainforests.
Tropical rainforests are found in
Western Ghats and Assam in India,
Southeast Asia, Central America and
Central Africa. Because of continuous
warmth and rain, this region supports
wide variety of plants and animals. The
major types of animals living in the
rainforests are monkeys, apes, gorillas,
lions, tigers, elephants, leopards, lizards,
snakes, birds and insects.
Let us read about the adaptations of
these animals to a hot, humid climate.
The climatic conditions in rainforests
are highly suitable for supporting an
enormous number and variety of
animals.
Since the numbers are large, there
is intense competition for food and
shelter. Many animals are adapted to
living on the trees. Red-eyed frog
(Fig. 7.7) has developed sticky pads on
its feet to help it climb trees on which it
lives. To help them live on the trees,
monkeys (Fig. 7.8) have long tails for
grasping branches. Their hands and feet
Fig. 7.8 A new world monkey
are such that they can easily hold on to
the branches.
As there is competition for food, some
animals are adapted to get food not
easily reachable. A striking example is
that of the bird Toucan (Fig. 7.9), which
possesses a long, large beak. This helps
a toucan to reach the fruits on branches
which are otherwise too weak to support
its weight.
Many tropical animals have sensitive
hearing, sharp eyesight, thick skin and
a skin colour which helps them to
camouflage by blending with the
surroundings. This is to protect them
from predators. For example, big cats

(Fig. 7.11). It has adapted to the
conditions of rainforests in many
remarkable ways. Look at its trunk. It
uses it as a nose because of which it
has a strong sense of smell. The trunk
is also used by it for picking up food.
Moreover, its tusks are modified teeth.
These can tear the bark of trees that
elephant loves to eat. So, the elephant
is able to handle the competition for food
rather well. Large ears of the elephant
help it to hear even very soft sounds.
They also help the elephant to keep cool
in the hot and humid climate of the
rainforest.
Fig. 7.9 Toucan Fig. 7.10 Lion-tailed
macaque
(lions and tigers) have thick skins and
sensitive hearing.
The lion-tailed macaque (also called
Beard ape) lives in the rainforests of
f
Western Ghats (Fig. 7.10). Its most
outstanding feature is the silver-white
mane, which surrounds the head from
the cheeks down to its chin. It is a good
climber and spends a major part of its
life on the tree. It feeds mainly on fruits.
It also eats seeds, young leaves, stems,
flowers and buds. This beard ape also
searches for insects under the bark of
the trees. Since it is able to get sufficient
food on the trees, it rarely comes down
on the ground.
Another well-known animal of Indian

What you have learnt
The day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to
the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-speed, etc., is called the
weather at that place.
The weather is generally not the same on any two days and week after
week.
The maximum temperature of the day occurs generally in the afternoon
while the minimum temperature occurs in the early morning.
The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year.
All the changes in the weather are driven by the sun.
The average weather pattern taken over a long time, say 25 years, is
called the climate of the place.
The tropical and the polar regions are the two regions of the earth,
which have severe climatic conditions.
Animals are adapted to the conditions in which they live.
The polar regions are very cold throughout the year. The sun does not
set for six months in a year and in the other six months it does not rise.
Animals in the polar region are adapted to the extremely cold climate by
having some special characteristics such as white fur, strong sense of
smell, a layer of fat under the skin, wide and large paws for swimming
and walking, etc.
Migration is another means to escape the harsh, cold conditions.
Because of the hospitable climatic conditions huge populations of plants
and animals are found in the tropical rainforests.
Animals in the tropical rainforests are adapted such that they eat
different kinds of food to overcome the competition for food and shelter.
Some adaptations of animals living in the tropical rainforests include
living on the trees, development of strong tails, long and large beaks,
bright colours, sharp patterns, loud voice, diet of fruits, sensitive hearing,
sharp eyesight, thick skin, ability to camouflage in order to protect
themselves from predators, etc.

Winds, Storms and Cyclones
rissa was hit by a cyclone with
wind speed of 200 km/h on
18 October 1999. The cyclone
smashed 45,000 houses making
7,00,000 people homeless. On
29 October the same year, a second
cyclone with wind speed of 260 km/h
hit Orissa again. It was accompanied by
water waves about 9 m high. Thousands
of people lost their lives. Property worth
crores of rupees was destroyed. The
cyclone affected agriculture, transport,
communication, and electricity supply.
But, what are cyclones? How are
they formed? Why are they so
destructive? In this chapter we shall
seek answers to some of these questions.
We begin with some activities
involving air. These activities will clarify
some basic features concerning a
cyclone. Before we begin, remember that
the moving air is called the wind.

experiences which show that the air has
pressure.
Let us now try to explain why the
can (or the bottle) gets distorted. As
water is poured over the can, some
steam in the can condenses into water,
reducing the amount of air inside. The
pressure of air inside the can decreases
than the pressure exerted by the air
from outside the can. As a result the
can gets compressed.
This activity again confirms that air
exerts pressure.

you know that a bicycle tube overfilled

inside the tube?
Discuss with your friends how the

Let us try to understand the
observations in Activities 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.
Were the observations along the lines
you thought? Do you get the feeling
that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure?
When we blow into the mouth of the
bottle, the air near the mouth has higher
speed. This decreases the pressure
there. The air pressure inside the bottle
is higher than near the mouth. The air
inside the bottle pushes the ball out.

in the figure. Observe what happens.
Why is the balance of the bags
disturbed?
Does this activity indicate that warm
air rises up? As the warm air rises up,
it pushes the bag above the candle. Does
the disturbance of the balance suggest
that the warm air is lighter than the cold
air?
Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.
8.4 WIND CURRENTS ARE GENERATED
DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON
THE EARTH
These situations are:
(a) Uneven heating between
the equator and the poles
You might have learnt in Geography that
regions close to the equator get
maximum heat from the Sun. The air
in these regions gets warm. The warm
air rises, and the cooler air from the

SCIENCE
regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.
(b) Uneven heating of land
and water
You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).
The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam', which means
‘season'.
In winter, the direction of the wind
flow gets reversed; it flows from the land
to the ocean (Fig. 8.10).

winds do for us.

water cycle.
The monsoon winds carry water

Clouds bring rain and give us

depend mainly on rains for their
harvests. There are many folk songs
associated with clouds and rain. Sing
and enjoy with your friends, if you know
such a song. Here is one for you.
The winds would have flown in the

in direction is however, caused by the
rotation of the earth.

SCIENCE
8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.

that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has

growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

9.4 PROPERTIES OF SOIL
You have listed some uses of soil. Let us
perform some activities to find the
characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

the time when you start pouring water.
When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time
again. Be careful not to let the water
spill over or run down on the outside of
the pipe while pouring. Calculate the
rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)
percolation time (min)
For example, suppose that for a
certain sample, it took 20 minutes for
200 mL to percolate. So,
on 200 mL
rate of percolation = = 10 mL/min
“ 20 min
Calculate the rate of percolation in
your soil sample. Compare your findings
with others and arrange the soil samples
in the increasing order of the rate of
percolation.
9.5 MOISTURE IN SOIL
Have you ever passed through a
farmland during a hot summer day?
Perhaps you noticed that the air above
the land is shimmering. Why is it so?
Try out this activity and find the answer.
Activity 9.5
Take a boiling tube. Put two spoonfulls
of a soil sample in it. Heat it on a flame
(Fig. 9.6) and observe it. Let us find out
what happens upon heating.
Do you see water drops any where?
If yes, where did you find them?
On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.
9.6 ABSORPTION OF WATER BY SOIL
Do all the soils absorb water to the same
extent? Let us find out.
Activity 9.6
Take a plastic funnel. Take a filter paper
(or a piece of newspaper sheet), fold and
place it as shown in the figure. Weigh
50g of dry, powdered soil and pour it
into the funnel. Measure a certain
amount of water in a measuring cylinder
and pour it drop by drop on the soil.
You can use a dropper for this purpose.
Do not let all the water fall at one spot.

Pour water all over the soil. Keep pouring
water till it starts dripping. Subtract the

for all the samples? Discuss the results
with your friends and answer the
following question:

percolation rate?
Which soil would have the lowest
percolation rate?
• Boojho heard from his neighbourer
that 8–10 days after the rain, the level
of water in a pond or well rises. Which
type of soil will allow water to reach
a well faster and in greater amount?
Which type of soil retains the highest
amount of water and which retains
the least?

more rain water percolate and reach
the water underground?
9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

What you have learnt
Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.

hours. This activity is best done in the afternoon. Take care that the
soil does not spill outside the newspaper. After drying it, weigh the soil
again. The difference in the weight of the soil before and after drying
gives you the amount of moisture contained in 100 g of soil. This is
called the percentage moisture content.

increasing rate of breathing according
to your experience.
10.3 How Do WE BREATHE?
Let us now learn about the mechanism
of breathing. Normally we take in air
through our nostrils. When we inhale
air, it passes through our nostrils into
the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity,
the air reaches our lungs through the
windpipe. Lungs are present in the
chest cavity (Fig. 10.4). This cavity is
surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,
muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 10.4).
Breathing involves the movement of the
diaphragm and the rib cage.
During inhalation, ribs move up and
outwards and diaphragm moves down.
This movement increases space in our
chest cavity and air rushes into the
lungs. The lungs get filled with air.
During exhalation, ribs move down and
inwards, while diaphragm moves up to
its former position. This reduces the size
of the chest cavity and air is pushed out
of the lungs (Fig. 10.5). These
movements in our body can be felt

The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust,
pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the
nasal cavity. Then they irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we
sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-
free, clean air enters our body.
TAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign
particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.

These openings are called spiracles
(Fig. 10.9). Insects have a network of air
tubes called tracheae for gas exchange.
Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles
into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the
body tissue, and reaches every cell of
the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from
the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and
moves out through spiracles. These air
tubes or tracheae are found only in
insects and not in any other group of

dioxide. In the cells oxygen is used to
break down glucose into carbon dioxide
and water as in other organisms. In
plants each part can independently take
in oxygen from the air and give out
carbon dioxide. You have already learnt
in Chapter 1 that the leaves of the plants
have tiny pores called stomata for
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Paheli wants to know whether
roots, which are underground
also take in oxygen? If so, how?
10.6 BREATHING UNDER WATER
Can we survive in water? There are many
organisms which live in water. How do
they breathe under water?
You have studied in Class VI that
gills in fish help them to use oxygen
dissolved in water. Gills are projections
of the skin. You may wonder how gills
help in breathing. Gills are well supplied
with blood vessels (Fig. 10.10) for
exchange of gases.
Like all other living cells of the
plants, the root cells also need
oxygen to generate energy. Roots take
up air from the air spaces present
between the soil particles (Fig. 10.11).

What you have learnt
Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms. It releases energy
from the food.
The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide
and water. Energy is released in the process.
The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellular
respiration).
If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic
respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the
respiration is called anaerobic respiration.
During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is
insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.
Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an
organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon
dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different
organisms.
During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original
state as the air moves out during exhalation.
Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.
In animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and the
process of breathing are similar to those in humans.
In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In
fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.
In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores
called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of
glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings.

SCIENCE
Transportation in Animals
and Plants
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 11.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in plants and animals.
11.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Heart

Artery
Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is a liquid, which has
cells of various kinds suspended in it.
Ella
Why is the colour of
blood red?
Fig. 11.1 Circulatory system
(Arteries are shown in red colour and vein in blue)
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.
Activity 11.1
The fluid part of the blood is called
plasma.
One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin bind
with oxygen and transports it to all the
parts of the body and ultimately to all
the cells. It will be difficult to provide
oxygen efficiently to all the cells of
the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 10. So, two types of
blood vessels are present in the arteries
and veins of the body. (Fig. 11.1)
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 11.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.

I am confused! I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygen-rich blood.
2010
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart.
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.

Refer to Fig. 11.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels. On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join up to
form veins which empty into the heart.
Heart
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 11.1). Hold your

makes your fist. Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four
chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 11.4). The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

SCIENCE
to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your
heart by listening through a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.

carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heartbeats. How many times did your
heartbeat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4-5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and
heartbeat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 11.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heartbeat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heartbeat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not posses any
circulatory system. The water in which
they live brings food and oxygen as it
enters their bodies. The water carries
away waste materials and carbon dioxide
as it moves out. Thus, these animals do
not need a circulatory fluid like the
blood.
Let us now learn about the remova
of waste other than carbon dioxide.
11.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells perform their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion forms the excretory system.
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578-1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called “circulator”. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harvey's idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.

seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat.
Does sweat serve any other function?
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot, which causes cooling.

whether other animals also
urinate?

The way in which waste chemicals are
removed from the body of the animal
depends on the availability of water.
Aquatic animals like fishes, excrete cell
waste in gaseous form (ammonia)
which directly dissolves in water. Some
land animals like birds, lizards,
snakes excrete a semi-solid, white
coloured compound (uric acid). The

tube-like ureters. It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 11.6).
The kindeys, ureters, bladder and
urethra form the excretory system.
An adult human being normally
passes about 1-1.8 L of urine in 24
hours, and the urine consists of 95%
water, 2.5 % urea and 2.5% other waste
products.
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day. The sweat
Sometimes a person's kidneys may
stop working due to infection or

waste products start accumulating in
the blood. Such persons cannot

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 11.7 (b)].

get inside the potato? For very short
distances water can move from one cell

Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants release
a lot of water by the process of
transpiration.
Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil. Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant. The
water evaporates through the stomata
present on the surface of the leaves by

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products to
different parts of the body for excretion.
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.
In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.
Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.
The human heart beats about 70-80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a
urinary bladder, and urethra.
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.

SCIENCE
Fish excrete waste substances which directly dissolve in water.
Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.
Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil.
Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the

The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the
plant is phloem.
A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata
during transpiration.
Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the
roots from the soil, to reach the stem and leaves.

learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
12.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? The flowers perform the function
of reproduction in plants. Flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. A
flower may have either the male part or
the female part or both male and female
parts.
There are several ways by which

categorised into two types: (i) asexual,

Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds or
spores.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Sind
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.

You must have seen flower buds

flower buds, there are buds in the axil
(point of attachment of the leaf at the
node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 12.2). A bud consists of a
short stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are folded. The
vegetative buds can also give rise to new
plants.

Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.
REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS

Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

are present in the air. Repeat Activity
1.2. Observe the spores in the cotton-

like mesh on the bread. When spores
are released they keep floating in the
air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

Activity 12.4
Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil.
The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

water. Insects visit flowers and carry
away pollen on their bodies. Some of
the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)
and (b)].

gametes (to form a zygote) is called
fertilisation (Fig. 12.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
12.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango, apple and orange. Some fruits
are hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 12.12 (a) and (b)].
12.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.
Sometimes after a walk through a forest
or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

Motion and Time
'n Class VI, you learnt about different
types of motions. You learnt that a
-motion could be along a straight line,
it could be circular or periodic. Can you
recall these three types of motions?
Table 13.1 gives some common
examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.

13.1 SLOW OR FAST
We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast.
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other.
Activity 13.1
Look at Fig. 13.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 13.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to
move. The distance covered by you after

direction on a road
it is easy to decide whose speed
is the highest. One who takes
shortest time to cover the
distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.
13.2 SPEED
You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
slower. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed
for one hour. In fact, it starts moving
slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of
a simple pendulum.
a constant speed or not during that
hour. The speed calculated here is
actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,
an Total distance covered
Total time taken
In everyday life we seldom find objects
| moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.
We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.
13.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME
If you did not have a clock, how would
you decide what time of the day it is?
Have you ever wondered how our elders
could tell the approximate time of the
day by just looking at shadows?
How do we measure time interval of
a month? A year?
Our ancestors noticed that many
events in nature repeat themselves after
definite intervals of time. For example,

clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that
by the clocks available earlier.
Units of time and speed
The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.

There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 -1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.
MOTION AND TIME
147
Different units of time are used
depending on the need. For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from ""two thousand and one"" to ""two
thousand and ten"". The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds. This rate may be
slightly higher for children.
Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 13.5).
13.4 MEASURING SPEED
Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.
Activity 13.3
Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 13.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?
GE
Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.
The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

While going for a school picnic, Paheli
decided to note the reading on the
odometer of the bus after every
30 minutes till the end of the journey.
Later on she recorded her readings in
Table 13.5.
Can you tell how far was the picnic
spot from the school? Can you calculate
the speed of the bus? Looking at the
Table, Boojho teased Paheli whether she
can tell how far they would have

Take a sheet of graph paper. Draw
two lines perpendicular to each other
on it, as shown in Fig. 13.11. Mark the
horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as
the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical
line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point
of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is
known as the origin O. The two
quantities between which the graph is
drawn are shown along these two axes.
We show the positive values on the
x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive
values on the y-axis are shown along
OY. In this chapter we shall consider
only the positive values of quantities.
You can make the graph by following
the steps given below:
Draw two perpendicular lines to
represent the two axes and mark
them as OX and OY as in Fig. 13.11.
Decide the quantity to be shown
along the x-axis and that to be
shown along the y-axis. In this case

we show the time along the x-axis
and the distance along the y-axis.
Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm
Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, ... on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km ... on the y-axis (Fig. 13.12).
Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 13.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 13.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the

Generally, the choice of scales is not
as simple as in the example given above.
We may have to choose two different scales
to represent the desired quantities on the
x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to
understand this process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 13.5. The total distance covered
by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to
choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall
have to draw an axis of length 80 cm.
This is not possible on a sheet of paper.
On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1
cm would require an axis of length only
8 cm. This scale is quite convenient.
However, the graph may cover only a
small part of the graph paper. Some of
the points to be kept in mind while
choosing the most suitable scale for
drawing a graph are:
the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.
the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and
to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that we have a graph paper
of size 25 cm 25 cm. One of the scales
which meets the above conditions and
can accommodate the data of Table 13.5
could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm
Can you now draw the distance-time
graph for the motion of the bus? Is the
graph drawn by you similar to that
shown in Fig. 13.13?
Distance-time graphs provide a
variety of information about the motion
154
SCIENCE
when compared to the data presented
by a table. For example, Table 13.5 gives
information about the distance moved
by the bus only at some definite time
intervals. On the other hand, from the
distance-time graph we can find the
distance moved by the bus at any
instant of time. Suppose we want to
know how much distance the bus had
travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point
corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on
the x-axis. Suppose this point is A. Next
we draw a line perpendicular to the
x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at
point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 13.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the
y-axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How muc
is this distance in km? Can you now
help Paheli to find the distance moved
by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also
find the speed of the bus from its

What you have Learnt
The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.
Speed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the
other.
The speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time taken
to cover that distance. Its basic unit is metre per second (m/s).
Periodic events are used for the measurement of time. Periodic motion of
a pendulum has been used to make clocks and watches.
Motion of objects can be presented in pictorial form by their
distance-time graphs.
The distance-time graph for the motion of an object moving with a constant
speed is a straight line.

1. You can make your own sundial and use it to mark the time of the day at
your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an
atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle
is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of
a circular board a shown in Fig. 13.16. One way to fix the gnomon could
be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.
Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 13.16. Mark the position of the tip
of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day
as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow
every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked
by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 13.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use
this sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember that
the gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction as
shown in Fig. 13.16.

anyone sitting on it. Find its time period in the same way as you did for
the pendulum. Make sure that there are no jerks in the motion of the
swing. Ask one of your friends to sit on the swing. Push
it once and let it swing naturally. Again measure its time period.
Repeat the activity with different persons sitting on the swing. Compare
the time period of the swing measured in different cases. What
conclusions do you draw from this activity?
Did you know?
The time-keeping services in India are provided by the National Physical
Laboratory, New Delhi. The clock they use can measure time intervals
with an accuracy of one-millionth of a second. The most accurate clock
in the world has been developed by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology in the U.S.A. This clock will lose or gain one second after
running for 20 million years.

Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
| touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
| off due to wear and tear. This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket. This may cause overload in
| the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?
166
SCIENCE
These days Miniature
circuit breakers (MCBs)
are increasingly being
used in place of fuses.
These are switches which
automatically turn off
when current in a circuit
exceeds the safe limit. You
turn them on and the
circuit is once again
complete. Look for ISI
mark on MCBs also.

CAUTION
Always, use proper fuses which have
been specified for particular
applications, carrying ISI mark. Never
use just any wire or strip of metal in
place of a fuse.
What do you observe? Does the compass
needle deflect? Move the switch back to
the ‘OFF' position. Does the compass
needle come back to its initial position?
Repeat the experiment a few times.
What does this experiment indicate?
We know that the needle of a compass
is a tiny magnet, which points in
north-south direction. When we bring
a magnet close to it, the needle gets
deflected. We have also seen that

Activity 14.5
Take the cardboard tray from inside a
discarded matchbox. Wrap an electric
wire a few times around the cardboard
tray. Place a small compass needle
inside it. Now connect the free ends of
this wire to an electric cell through a
switch as shown in Fig. 14.17.
Note the direction in which the
compass needle is pointing. Bring a bar
magnet near the compass needle.
Observe what happens. Now, while
watching the compass needle carefully,
move the switch to the ‘ON' position.

Remember not to switch on the
current for more than a few seconds
at a time. The electromagnet weakens
the cell quickly if left connected.
compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.
14.4 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 14.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6-10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 14.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.
14.5 ELECTRIC BELL
We are quite familiar with an electric bell.
It has an electromagnet in it. Let us see
how it works.
Fig. 14.20 shows the circuit of an
electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire
wound on an iron piece. The coil acts
Fig. 14.19 An electromagnet
168
SCIENCE
as an electromagnet. An iron strip with
a hammer at one end is kept close to
the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,
pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.

What you have learnt
It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols. Using these,
an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram.
When an electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets heated. It is
the heating effect of current. This effect has many applications.
Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed through them. These materials are
used for making electric fuses which prevent fires and damage to electric
appliances.
When an electric current flows through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
A current carrying coil of an insulated wire wrapped around a piece of
iron is called an electromagnet.
Electromagnets are used in many devices.

Paheli and Boojho saw a magic trick sometime back. The magician placed
an iron box on a stand. He then called Boojho and asked him to lift the
box. Boojho could easily lift the box. Now the magician made a show of
moving his stick around the box while muttering some thing. He again
asked Boojho to lift the box. This time Boojho could not even move it. The
magician again muttered some thing and now Boojho could lift the box.
The audience, including Paheli and Boojho, were very impressed with
the show and felt that the magician had some supernatural powers.
However, after reading this chapter Paheli is wondering if the trick was
indeed some magic or some science was involved? Can you guess what
science might be involved?

The credit for the invention of the electric bulb
is usually given to Thomas Alva Edison, though
others before him had worked on it. Edison
was a remarkable man. He made some 1300
inventions including the electric bulb,
gramophone, the motion picture camera and
the carbon transmitter, which facilitated the
invention of the telephone.

falls on it. This change of direction by a
mirror is called reflection of light. Can
you recall the activity in which you got
the light of a torch reflected from a

a straight pipe and then through

Boojho not able to see the candle
flame through a bent pipe?
This activity showed that
light travels along straight lines.
How can we change the path
of light? Do you know, what
happens when light falls on a
polished or a shiny surface?
15.2 REFLECTION OF LIGHT
One way to change the direction
of light is to let it fall on a shiny
surface. For example, a shining
stainless steel plate or a shining
steel spoon can change the
direction of light. The surface of
water can also act like a mirror
and change the path of light.

Handle the lighted candle with care.
It is better if this activity is performed

mirror strip vertically on the chart paper

on the mirror from the torch with slits.
Place the torch in such a way that its
light is seen along the chart paper on
the board. Now adjust its position so
that the light from the torch strikes the
plane mirror at an angle (Fig. 15.5).
Does the mirror change the direction
of light that falls on it? Now move the
torch slightly to either side. Do you find
any change in the direction of reflected
light?
Look into the mirror along the
direction of the reflected light. Do you
Place a lighted candle in front of a
plane mirror. Try to see the flame of the
candle in the mirror. It appears as if a
similar candle is placed behind the
mirror. The candle, which appears
behind the mirror, is the image of the
candle formed by the mirror (Fig. 15.6).
The candle itself is the object.
Now move the candle to different
positions in front of the mirror. Observe
the image in each case.
Paheli wants to know, what
makes things visible to us?
Boojho thinks that objects are
visible only when light reflected
from them reaches our eyes. Do
you agree with him?

Boojho noted in his notebook: Is
it not surprising that my image is
of the same size as me whether
the mirror is small or large?
Was the image upright in each case?
Did the flame appear on top of the candle
as in the object? Such an image is called
erect. An image formed by a plane
mirror is erect and of the same size as
the object.
Now place a vertical screen behind
the mirror. Try to obtain the image of
the candle on this screen. Can you get
the image on the screen? Now place the
screen in front of the mirror. Can you
get the image on the screen now? You
will find that the image of the candle
cannot be obtained on the screen in
either case.
What about the distance of the image
from mirror? Let us perform another
activity.
Activity 15.3
Take a chess board. If a chess board is
not available, draw on a chart paper 64
(88) squares of equal size. Draw a thick
line in the middle of the paper. Fix a
plane mirror vertically on this line. Place
any small object, such as a pencil
sharpner, at the boundary of the third
square counting from the mirror
(Fig. 15.7). Note the position of the
image. Now shift the object to the
boundary of the fourth square. Again
note the position of the image. Did you
find any relation between the distance
of the image from the mirror and that of
the object in front of it?

Paheli made a note in her notebook:
In a plane mirror the image is
formed behind the mirror. It is erect,
of the same size and is at the same
distance from the mirror as the
object is in front of it.

is at the same distance behind
the mirror as the object is in front

vehicle ahead of an ambulance looks in
her/his rear view mirror, s/he can read
‘AMBULANCE' written on it and give
way to it. It is the duty of every one of
us to allow an ambulance to pass
without blocking its way.

Now look at your image using the
inner side of the spoon. This time you

can also compare the image of your pen
or pencil instead of your face.
15.4 PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL
MIRRORS
Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their
dinner. Boojho lifted a stainless steel
plate and saw his image in it. Oh! This
plate acts as a plane mirror. My image
is erect and is of the same size. Paheli
saw her image using the back of a steel
spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind”, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image.
Activity 15.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it. Do you see your image
in it (Fig. 15.10)? Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?
Fig. 15.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon
The curved shining surface of a
spoon acts as a mirror. The most
common example of a curved mirror is
a spherical mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 15.12).

Why are concave and convex mirrors
called spherical mirrors?
Take a rubber ball and cut a
portion of it with a knife or a hack-
saw blade (Fig. 15.13 (a)]. (Be careful.
Ask an elder person to help you in
cutting the ball). The inner surface
of the cut ball is called concave and
the outer surface is called convex
(Fig. 15.13 (b)).

The inner surface of a spoon acts like
a concave mirror, while its outer surface
acts like a convex mirror.
We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.
Activity 15.6
Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 15.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 15.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror.
Activity 15.7
CAUTION
You will conduct Activity 15.6 in the
sunlight. Be careful, never look
directly towards the sun or its image
as it may damage your eyes. You may
look at the image of the sun when it
is thrown on a screen or a wall.
Fix a concave mirror on a stand (any
arrangement to keep the mirror steady
would do) and place it on a table
(Fig. 15.15). Paste a piece of white paper
on a cardboard sheet (say about

Keep a lighted candle on the table at a
distance of about 50 cm from the mirror.
Try to obtain the image of the flame on
the screen. For this, move the screen till
a sharp image of the flame is obtained
Make sure that, the screen does not
obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror. Is this image real or
virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame?
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 15.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 15.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
(Fig. 15.17). The reflectors of torches,
headlights of cars and scooters are

Can you now recognise the mirrors
used as side mirrors in scooters? These
are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can
form images of objects spread over a large
area. So, these help the drivers to see
the traffic behind them (Fig. 15.20).
15.5 IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES
You might have seen a magnifying glass.
It is used to read very small print
(Fig. 15.21). You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a
cockroach or an earthworm. The
magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.
Lenses are widely used in spectacles,
telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.
Get some lenses. Touch and feel
them. Can you find some difference just
by touching? Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges
are convex lenses (Fig. 15.22 (a)]. Those

Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens. Do you see a bright spot
A convex lens converges (bends
inward) the light generally falling on it
[Fig. 15.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a
converging lens. On the other hand, a
concave lens diverges (bends outward)
the light and is called a diverging lens

the nature and size of the image change.
Is it true for lenses also?
Let us find out.

Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand
as you did with the concave mirror. Place
it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a
distance of about 50 cm from the lens
[Fig. 15.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image
of the candle on a paper screen placed
on the other side of the lens. You may
have to move the screen towards or away
from the lens to get a sharp image of

What you have learnt
Light travels along straight lines.
Any polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.
An image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.
An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.
The image formed by a plane mirror is erect. It is virtual and is of the
same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.
In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on the
right side in the image, and right side of the object appears to be on the
left side in the image.
A concave mirror can form a real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified.
Image formed by a convex mirror is erect, virtual and smaller in size
than the object.
A convex lens can forms real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is called
a magnifying glass.
A concave lens always forms erect, virtual and smaller image than the
object.
White light is composed of seven colours.

Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 15.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an

teachers must very often be advising you
not to waste water. No wonder we
celebrate water day every year to attract
the attention of everybody towards the
importance of conserving water.
The amount of water recommended

Water shortage has become a matter
of concern throughout the world. It is
estimated that in a few years from now
more than one third of the people in
the world could face water scarcity.
Before we discuss why water is
getting scarce we must know how much
water is available for use on our planet.
16.1 HOW MUCH WATER IS AVAILABLE
Look at the picture of the earth taken
from space. Why does it appear blue?
Surely, you can guess!
You are aware that about 71% of
the earth's surface is covered with
water. Almost all the water on the
earth is contained in the seas and
oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as
groundwater and in the atmosphere.
However, most of this water is not fit for
human consumption. The water that is
fit for use is freshwater. Perform the

finding worry you? Discuss this in your

16.2 FORMS OF WATER
Are you afraid that continuous use will
some day exhaust all the water available
for use? You know that water on the
earth has been maintained for millions
of years by various processes which
make the water cycle. You have studied
the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your
own words what you know about the
water cycle.
You know that when water circulates
through the water cycle it can be found
in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid
and gas—at any given time somewhere
on the earth. The solid form, snow and
ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of
the earth, snow-covered mountains and
glaciers. Liquid water is present in
oceans, lakes, rivers, and even
underground. The gaseous form is the
water vapour present in the air around
us. The continuous cycling of water
among its three forms keeps the total
amount of water on the earth constant
even when the whole world is using it.
Does it give you any relief?
Can you recall the processes involved
in water cycle? The following activity will
help you.

bodies. The water is drawn from
nearby lakes, rivers, ponds or
wells. The water is supplied
through a network of pipes.
Many villages do not have such
a water supply system. There
people fetch water directly from
the sources. Often women and
children have to walk several
kilometres to fetch water
(Fig. 16.6). The children suffer
a lot. They cannot attend
school regularly since they
spend hours in fetching water.
Women have to
perform a number of
household chores. If they have
also to spend time to fetch water
it adds to their burden.
A large number of people draw water
from wells, tube wells or hand pumps.
From where do these sources get water?
16.3 GROUNDWATER AS AN IMPORTANT
SOURCE OF WATER
If we dig a hole in the ground near a
water body we may find that the soil is
moist. The moisture in the soil indicates
the presence of water underground. If
we dig deeper and deeper, we would
reach a level where all the space between
particles of soil and gaps between rocks
are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The
upper limit of this layer is called the
water table. The water table varies from
Fig. 16.6 Women fetching water
place to place, and it may even change
at a given place. The water table may be
at a depth of less than a metre or may
be several metres below the ground. The
water found below the water table is
called groundwater. What is the source
of this groundwater?
The rainwater and water from other
sources such as rivers and ponds seeps
through the soil and fills the empty
spaces and cracks deep below the
ground. The process of seeping of water
into the ground is called infiltration.
The groundwater thus gets recharged
by this process. At places the
groundwater is stored between layers of
hard rock below the water table. This is
known as an aquifer. Water in the
aquifers can be usually pumped out with
the help of tube wells or handpumps.
Have you ever been to a site where
construction work is going on? From

where do the workers get water for
construction? May be you have seen
boring being done at such sites to reach
the water table. Enquire from the people
working there how deep they have to dig.
Can we keep on drawing water from
under the ground? How will it affect the
water table?
16.4 DEPLETION OF WATER TABLE
Water drawn from under the ground gets
replenished by seepage of rainwater. The
water table does not get affected as long
as we draw as much water as is
replenished by natural processes.
However, water table may go down if the
water is not sufficiently replenished.
This may happen due to many reasons.
Increase in population, industrial and
agricultural activities are some common
factors affecting water table. Scanty
rainfall is another factor that may
deplete the water table. Yet another
factor affecting water table could be
deforestation and decrease in the
effective area for seepage of water.
Increasing population
Increasing population creates demand
for construction of houses, shops,
offices, roads and pavements. This
decreases the open areas like parks, and
playgrounds. This, in turn, decreases the
seepage of rainwater into the ground.
What could be the consequence? Recall
that a pukka floor does not allow water
to seep in easily, while in a grass lawn
water seeps through in no time.
198
SCIENCE
Moreover a huge amount of water is
required for construction work. Often
groundwater is used for this purpose.
So, on the one hand we are
consuming more groundwater, and on
the other we are allowing lesser water
to seep into the ground. This results in
depletion of water table. In fact, the
water table in some parts of many cities
has gone down to alarmingly low levels.
Increasing industries
Water is used by all the industries.
Almost everything that we use needs
water somewhere in its production
process. The number of industries is
increasing continuously. Water used by
most of the industries is drawn from the
ground.
day by day. This results in depletion of
water table.
16.5 DISTRIBUTION OF WATER
The distribution of water over the globe
is quite uneven due to a number of
factors.
Some places have good amount of
rain and are water-rich. On the other
hand, there are deserts which have
scanty rainfall.
India is a vast country and the
rainfall is not the same everywhere.
Some regions have excessive rains while
some others have very little rainfall.
Excessive rains cause floods, whereas
the absence of rains results in droughts.
Therefore, some regions in our country
may have floods while others may suffer
from droughts at the same time.
Activity 16.5
Activity 16.4
Name some industries familiar to you.
Make a list of the products obtained
from these and used in our daily life.
Discuss with your teacher and parents
how the growing industrial activity is
responsible for the depletion of water
table.
Agricultural activities
A majority of farmers in India depend
upon rains for irrigating their crops.
Irrigation systems such as canals are
there only in a few places. Even these
systems may suffer from lack of water
due to erratic rainfall. Therefore, farmers
have to use groundwater for irrigation.
Population pressure on agriculture
forces increasing use of groundwater
Given here is the rainfall map of India
(Fig. 16.8). It gives the average annual
rainfall in different regions of our country.
Locate on the map the place you live
in.
Are you blessed with sufficient
rainfall?
Is there sufficient water available in
your area throughout the year?
It may be possible that we are living
in an area where there is sufficient
rainfall yet there is shortage of water. Can
we attribute this to mismanagement of
water resources?

provided by a well-planned pipe system.
When the civic authorities supply water
through pipes not all of it may reach
the destination. You might have seen
water supply pipes leaking and a lot of
water gushing out of the pipes. It is
the responsibility of the civic
authorities to prevent such wastage of
precious water.
Mismanagement or wastage may
take place at the level of individuals also.
All of us, knowingly or unknowingly,
waste water while brushing teeth,
shaving, bathing, washing and during
many other activities. Leaking taps is
another source of huge water wastage.
We waste water as though we do not need
water the next time!
We have seen that most of the water
that we get as rainfall just flows away.
This is a waste of precious natural
resource. The rainwater can be used to
recharge the groundwater. This is
referred to as water harvesting or
rainwater harvesting, about which you
have learnt in Class VI.
Find out if the buildings in your
neighbourhood have water harvesting
systems installed.
We have at many places in India an
age old practice of water storage and
water recharge like the bawris. Bawri
was the traditional way of collecting
water. With time the bawris fell into
disuse and garbage started piling in these
reservoirs. However, because of the acute
water shortage, people in these areas
have had to rethink. The bawris are being
revived. Today the situation is that inspite
of scanty rains these places are
managing their water needs well.
A farmer using water in the field can
also use water economically. Maybe
you have heard of drip irrigation
(Fig. 16.9). Drip irrigation is a technique
of watering plants by making use of
narrow tubings which deliver water
directly at the base of the plant.
A case study
Bhujpur in the Kutch area of Gujarat has a very erratic rainfall. The only source
of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water
throughout the year. Over the years, demand for water has grown. The withdrawal
of groundwater has far exceeded recharge. As a result the water table has gone
down alarmingly.
In 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to
harvest rainwater. Eighteen check-dams were built on the Rukmavati river and
its many tributaries. The water so collected increased percolation through the
soil and recharged the aquifers.
According to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into
the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation.

16.7 WHAT ROLE YOU CAN PLAY
Have you ever shown concern if you saw
a tap leaking in your house, school or
any other place? Leaking taps waste a
lot of water. You must make efforts to
stop this leakage.
There are a number of ways you can
adopt to minimise the wastage of water.
Let us begin. We have given a few
examples. Add on!
16.8 EFFECT OF WATER SCARCITY ON
PLANTS
You must have seen potted plants
wilting and ultimately drying up if they
did not get water even for a few days.
You have already learnt in Chapter 1
that plants need water to get nutrients
from the soil to prepare their food. Just
imagine the consequences if water is not
available to plants!
The green character of the planet
shall be lost. This may mean the end
of all life, for a world without plants
shall mean no food, no oxygen, not
enough rain, and innumerable other
problems.
A successful initiative
Rajasthan is a hot and dry place. The challenge of natural scarcity of water was
met by a successful experiment. A band of social workers has transformed a dry
area in the Alwar district into a green place. They have revived five dried-up
rivers — Arveri, Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahazwali by constructing water-
harvesting structures.

SCIENCE
What you have learnt
Water is essential for all living beings. There can be no life without it.
Water exists in three forms: solid, liquid and vapour.
Though water is maintained by the water cycle, yet there is an acute
scarcity of water in many parts of the globe.
There is an uneven distribution of water. Much of it has resulted from
human activities.
Rapid growth of industries, increasing population, growing irrigation
requirements and mismanagement are some of the causes for water
shortage.
We need to be worried about the wastage during the supply of water
through pipes, the leaking taps in buildings and other places.
Unnecessary use of water and overdrawing from groundwater should be
avoided. Recharge of water to the ground should be increased.
The need of the hour is that every individual uses water economically.

Forests: Our Lifeline
ne evening Boojho entered the
park with an elderly person. He
introduced him to his friends.
Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in
the university. The children started
playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a
bench in the corner. He was tired as he
had participated in the golden jubilee
celebrations of the town. After a while,
the children also came and sat around
him. They wanted to know about the
celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that
after the cultural programme, the
senior people discussed the town's
unemployment problem. A plan was
proposed to put up a factory by clearing
an area of the forest just outside the
town. This would give the increasing
population of the town a chance to get
jobs. The children were very surprised
when Prof Ahmad told them that many
people had objected to this idea.
“This is because the forests serve as
green lungs and water purifying systems
in nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The
children were confused. Prof Ahmad
realised that the children had not visited
a forest. The children also wanted to
know more about the forest, so they
decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.
17.1 VISIT TO A FOREST
One Sunday morning, the children
packed a few things like a knife, a hand
lens, a stick, a notebook and walked
together through a forest trail near a
village. On their way, they met Tibu, a
young boy of their age group, of nearby
village, who was taking cattle for grazing
along with his aunt. He was very agile,
running here and there to keep the herd
together. When he saw the children,
Tibu also started walking along with
them, while his aunt went on a different
path. As soon as they entered the forest
Tibu raised his hand and signalled them
to keep quiet because noise could
disturb the animals living in the forest.
Tibu then took them to a place at a
height to show them the broad view of
the forest. Children were surprised
because they could not see any land
(Fig. 17.1). The different treetops had
formed green cover over the land. However,
the cover was not uniformly green. The

M
environment was peaceful and a cool
breeze was blowing. This made children
quite fresh and happy.
While coming down, they got excited
on hearing a sudden sound of birds and
some noise from the top branches of the
trees. Tibu told them to relax since it
was a normal phenomenon here.
Because of the children's presence, some
monkeys had climbed higher up on the
trees where they disturbed the birds.
Animals often give this type of warning
call to alert other animals. Tibu also told
that many other animals like boar,
bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live
in the deeper areas of the forest
(Fig. 17.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned
children that they should not go deep
into the forest.
Boojho and Paheli remembered that
they have studied about forests as

The land where the children were
walking was uneven and covered with
many trees. Tibu helped them to identify
sal, teak, semal, sheesham, neem,
palash, fig, khair, amla, bamboo,
kachnar (Fig. 17.4). Prof Ahmad pointed
out that there are several other trees,
shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.
The trees were also covered with different
types of creepers and climbers. The sun
was barely visible through the leaves of
the trees, making it quite dark inside
the forest.
Activity 17.1
Observe the various things in your home
and make a list of those which are made
from material which may have been
obtained from the forest.
You might have many wooden items
on your list like plywood, fuel wood,
boxes, paper, matchsticks, and
furniture. Do you know that gum, oils,
spices, fodder for animals and medicinal
plants are also some of the products
which we get from the forest (Fig. 17.5).

Sheila wondered who would have
planted these trees. Prof Ahmad replied
that in nature trees produce enough
seeds. The forest floor provides
favourable conditions for them to
germinate and develop into seedlings

Prof Ahmad asked children to look
up and observe how the branches of the
tall trees look like a roof over the other
plants in the forest. He told them that
this is called a canopy (Fig. 17.7).
Activity 17.2
Visit a forest or a park in your
neighbourhood. Observe the trees and
try to identify them. You can take the
help of some elders or books on trees.
List the characteristics of the trees that
you observe, such as the height, shape
of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also
draw the crowns of some trees.
Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees
had crowns of different types and sizes.
These had created different horizontal
layers in the forest. These are known as
understoreys (Fig. 17.7). Giant and tall
trees constituted the top layer followed
by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs
formed the lowest layer.
“Would we see similar kind of trees
in every forest?” — asked Boojho.
Prof Ahmad said, “No, due to different
climatic conditions there are variations
in the types of trees and other plants.
The types of animals also differ from
forest to forest.”

They came across numerous insects, seeds, twigs and small herbs. The
spiders, squirrels, ants and various decaying matter was moist and warm.
Children picked up various seeds
and leaves for their collection. Walking
over the dead leaf layer on the forest floor
was like walking over a spongy carpet!
Is the decaying matter always warm?
Prof Ahmad suggested that the children
could perform an activity to get an
answer to this question.

upper layer of the soil. Does the pit feel

Paheli asked, “There are so many
trees here. Also, there are many forest
like this. What difference will it make if
we cut some trees for a factory?”
Prof Ahmad said, “You have read
about autotrophs, heterotrophs and
saprotrophs. You have learnt how green
plants produce food. All animals,
whether herbivores or carnivores,
depend ultimately on plants for food.
Organisms which feed on plants often
get eaten by other organisms, and so
on. For example, grass is eaten by
insects, which in turn, is taken by the
frog. The frog is consumed by snakes.
This is said to form a food chain:
Grass → insects → frog → snake → eagle.
Many food chains can be found in the
forest. All food chains are linked. If any
one food chain is disturbed, it affects
other food chains. Every part of the
forest is dependent on the other parts.
If we remove one component, say trees,
all other components would be affected.”
Prof Ahmad asked children to pick
up leaves from the forest floor and
observe them under a hand lens. They

plants release oxygen through the
process of photosynthesis. The plants
help to provide oxygen for animal
respiration. They also maintain the
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere (Fig. 17.10). That is
why forests are called lungs.
Paheli reminded their

decaying leaves. They also saw an army
of tiny insects, millipedes, ants and
beetle on them. They were wondering
how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad
explained that apart from these animals
which are easily seen, there are several
organisms and micro-organisms that
live in the soil. Paheli wondered what
mushroom and other micro-organisms
eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed
upon the dead plant and animal tissues
and convert them into a dark coloured
substance called humus.
You have learnt about humus in
Chapter 9. In which layer of the soil
would you find humus? What is its
importance to the soil?
The micro-organisms which convert
the dead plants and animals to humus
are known as decomposers. These
micro-organisms play an important role
in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some
dead leaves and discovered under them
a layer of humus on forest floor. The
presence of humus ensures that the
nutrients of the dead plants and
animals are released into the soil. From
there, these nutrients are again absorbed
by the roots of the living plants. “What
happens if an animal dies in the forest?”
Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead
animals become food for vultures, crows,
jackals and insects.” In this way, the
nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes
waste in a forest (Fig. 17.9).
Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he
had not explained why forests are called
green lungs. Prof Ahmad explained that

Trees take in water from their roots and

through evaporation.
If there were fewer trees, how will the
water cycle be affected?
Tibu told them that the forest is not
just home to plants and animals. Many
people also live in the forest. Some of
them may belong to different tribes. Tibu
explained that these people depend

What you have learnt
We get various products from the forests surrounding us.
Forest is a system comprising various plants, animals and
micro-organisms.
In a forest, trees form the uppermost layer, followed by shrubs.
The herbs form the lowest layer of vegetation.
Different layers of vegetation provide food and shelter for animals,
birds and insects.
The various components of the forest are interdependent on one
another.
The forest keeps on growing and changing, and can regenerate.
In the forest, there is interaction between soil, water, air and
living organisms.
Forests protect the soil from erosion.
Soil helps forests to grow and regenerate.
Forests are the lifeline for the forest-dwelling communities.
Forests influence climate, water cycle and air quality.

Activity 18.4
Divide yourself into groups to perform

stage:
• Fill a large glass jar 3/4 full of water.
Add some dirty organic matter such
as grass pieces or orange peels, a
small amount of detergent, and a few
drops of an ink or any colour.
• Cap the jar, shake it well and let the
mixture stand in the sun for two
days.
After two days, shake the mixture
and pour a small sample into test
tube. Label this test tube “Before
treatment; Sample 1”. How does it
smell?
• Use an aerator from an aquarium to
bubble air through the sample in the
glass jar. Allow several hours for
aeration; leave the aerator attached
overnight. If you do not have an
aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or
a mixer. You may have to stir it
several times.
The next day when aeration is
complete, pour another sample into
a second test tube. Label it as “After
aeration; Sample 2”.
Fold a piece of filter paper to form a
cone. Wet the paper with tap water
and then insert the cone in a funnel.
Mount the funnel on a support
(as you have learnt in Class VI).
Place layers of sand, fine gravel and
finally medium gravel in the funnel
(Fig. 18.2). (An actual filtration plant
does not use filter paper, but the sand
filter is several metres deep).
Pour the remaining aerated liquid
through the filter into the beakers.
Do not allow the liquid to spill over
the filter. If the filtered liquid is not
clear, filter it a few times till you get
clear water.
· Pour a sample of the filtered water
into a third test tube labelled
“Filtered; Sample 3”.
. Pour another sample of the filtered
water into a fourth test tube. Add a
small piece of a chlorine tablet. Mix
well until the water is clear. Label the
test tube “Chlorinated; Sample 4"".

the test tubes. Do not taste! Just
smell them!
Now answer the following questions:
(a) What changes did you observe in the
appearance of the liquid after
aeration?
(b) Did aeration change the odour?
(c) What was removed by the sand filter?
(d) Did chlorine remove the colour?
(e) Did chlorine have an odour? Was it
worse than that of the wastewater?
18.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
(WWTP)
Treatment of wastewater involves
physical, chemical, and biological
processes, which remove physical,
chemical and biological matter that
contaminates the wastewater.
1. Wastewater is passed through bar
screens. Large objects like rags,
sticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins
are removed (Fig. 18.3).
Fig. 18.4 Grit and sand removal tank
3. The water is then allowed to settle in
a large tank which is sloped towards
the middle. Solids like faeces settle
at the bottom and are removed with
a scraper. This is the sludge. A
skimmer removes the floatable solids
like oil and grease. Water so cleared
is called clarified water (Fig. 18.5).
WASTEWATER STORY
223
The activated sludge is about 97%
water. The water is removed by sand
drying beds or machines. Dried sludge
is used as manure, returning organic
matter and nutrients to the soil.
The treated water has a very low level
of organic material and suspended
matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river
or into the ground. Nature cleans it up
further. Sometimes it may be necessary
to disinfect water with chemicals like
chlorine and ozone before releasing it
into the distribution system.
Become an active citizen
Waste generation is a natural part of
human activity. But we can limit the
type of waste and quantity of waste
produced. Often we have been repelled
by offensive smell. The sight of open
drains is disgusting. The situation
Fig. 18.5 Water clarifer
The sludge is transferred to a
separate tank where it is decomposed
by the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas
produced in the process can be used as
fuel or can be used to produce electricity.
4. Air is pumped into the clarified water
to help aerobic bacteria to grow.
Bacteria consume human waste,
food waste, soaps and other
unwanted matter still remaining in
clarified water (Fig. 18.6).
After several hours, the suspended
microbes settle at the bottom of the tank
as activated sludge. The water is then
removed from the top.
The water in a river is cleaned
naturally by processes that are
similar to those adopted in a
wastewater treatment plant.
Did you know?
It has been suggested that we should
plant eucalyptus trees all along
sewage ponds. These trees absorb all
surplus wastewater rapidly and
release pure water vapour into the
atmosphere.

PRACTICES
One of the ways to minimise or eliminate
waste and pollutants at their source is
to see what you are releasing down the
drain.
• Cooking oil and fats should not be
thrown down the drain. They can
harden and block the pipes. In an
open drain the fats clog the soil pores
reducing its effectiveness in filtering
water. Throw oil and fats in the
dustbin.
Chemicals like paints, solvents,
insecticides, motor oil, medicines
may kill microbes that help purify
water. So do not throw them down

Vermi-processing toilet
A design of a toilet in which humans excreta is treated by earthworms has been
tested in India. It has been found to be a novel, low water-use toilet for safe
processing of human waste. The operation of the toilet is very simple and hygienic.
The human excreta is completely converted to vermi cakes — a resource much
needed for soil.
without sewerage facilities. Where do
they relieve themselves?
A very large fraction of our people
defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds,
on railway tracks, near fields and many
a time directly in water. Untreated
human excreta is a health hazard. It
may cause water pollution and soil
pollution. Both the surface water and
groundwater get polluted. Groundwater
is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
springs and many rivers as you learnt
in Chapter 16. Thus, it becomes the
most common route for water borne
diseases. They include cholera, typhoid,
polio, meningitis, hepatitis and
dysentery.
18.8 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR
SEWAGE DISPOSAL
To improve sanitation, low cost onsite
sewage disposal systems are being
encouraged. Examples are septic tanks,
chemical toilets, composting pits. Septic
tanks are suitable for places where there
is no sewerage system, for hospitals,
isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5
houses.
Some organisations offer hygienic
on-site human waste disposal
technology. These toilets do not require
scavenging. Excreta from the toilet seat
flow through covered drains into a
biogas plant. The biogas produced is
used as a source of energy.
18.9 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES
In our country fairs are organised
periodically. A large number of people
participate in them. In the same way
railway stations, bus depots, airports,
hospitals are very busy places.
Thousands of people visit them daily.
Large amount of waste is generated
here. It must be disposed of properly
otherwise epidemics could break out.
The government has laid down
certain standards of sanitation but,
unfortunately, they are not strictly
enforced.
However, all of us can contribute in
maintaining sanitation at public places.
We should not scatter litter anywhere.
If there is no dustbin in sight, we should
carry the litter home and throw it in the
dustbin.

Conclusion
We all have a role to play in keeping our
environment clean and healthy. You
must realise your responsibility in
maintaining the water sources in a
healthy state. Adopting good sanitation
practices should be our way of life. As

initiative will make a great difference.

What you have learnt
Used water is wastewater. Wastewater could be reused.
Wastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in
other human activities. This is called sewage.
Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution.
Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.
Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature
can take care of it.
Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are
not available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted.
By-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas.
Open drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organisms
which cause diseases.
We should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal of
excreta by low cost methods.

One of the ancient civilisations, Harappa and Mohenjodaro had perhaps
the world's first urban sanitation system. Within the city individual
houses, or groups of houses, obtained water from wells. There was a
separate room for bathing, and wastewater was directed to the covered
drains which lined the major streets. The oldest toilet made of bricks is
about 4500 years old.

Reproduction in Plants
and (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual
reproduction plants can give rise to new
plants without seeds, whereas in sexual

But, she has never seen the seeds

lo produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms. You have already
learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
12.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? The flowers perform the function
of reproduction in plants. Flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. A
flower may have either the male part or
the female part or both male and female
parts.
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring. These are
categorised into two types: (i) asexual,
D
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds or
spores.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Sind
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.

Bud in
the axil
Fig. 12.1 Stem-cutting of rose
You must have seen flower buds
developing into flowers. Apart from
flower buds, there are buds in the axil
(point of attachment of the leaf at the
node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 12.2). A bud consists of a
short stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are folded. The
vegetative buds can also give rise to new
plants.
Activity 12.2
Take a fresh potato. Observe the scars
on it with the help of a magnifying glass.
You may find bud(s) in them. These scars
are also called “eyes”. Cut a few pieces

nutrients are made available to them.
Remember that yeast is a single-celled
organism. Let us see how they
reproduce?
Activity 12.3

powder from a bakery or a chemist shop.
Take a pinch of yeast and place it in a
container with some water. Add a
spoonful of sugar and shake to dissolve
it. Keep it in the warm part of a room.
After an hour, put a drop of this liquid
on a glass slide and observe under a
microscope. What do you observe? You
may see the formation of new yeast cells
(Fig. 12.5).
Boojho wants to know if
there is any advantage of
vegetative propagation.

Fig. 12.5 Reproduction in yeast by budding
Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.

You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

Spore formation
In Chapter 1 you learnt that the fungi
on a bread piece grow from spores which
are present in the air. Repeat Activity
1.2. Observe the spores in the cotton-
Sporangium
like mesh on the bread. When spores
are released they keep floating in the
air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

SCIENCE
Activity 12.4
Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil.
The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

Boojho wants to know how the
male gamete in the pollen grain

water. Insects visit flowers and carry
away pollen on their bodies. Some of
the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)
and (b)].

gametes (to form a zygote) is called
fertilisation (Fig. 12.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
12.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango, apple and orange. Some fruits
are hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 12.12 (a) and (b)].
12.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.
Sometimes after a walk through a forest
or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

SCIENCE
Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

Temperature_2,Explanation,Science,good morning children today we should learn about temperature and how to measure the temperature we often say the soup is hot on the ice cream is very cold but never ever wondered what makes the soup hot are the ice cream cold some objects are hotter than the other like the soup on the left side is hotter than the soup on the right side some objects are colder than the other like this ice cream is colder than this cold drink so what makes things hotter or folder when you get fever your body becomes hotter than the normal you know how hot your body has become your mother put the thermometer in your mouth or under the arms temperature is the quantity that tells us how hot or cold an object is so the temperature is degree of hotness or coldness of a body or a place like the boiling water is very hot as it has high temperature and ice cream is very cold as it has very low temperature when we put a pot of water on the stuff and heated its temperature rises the heat is form of energy and it is the cause of temperature it means temperature is an expression of heat energy hot water becomes cold when it releases heat so cold water has lesser heat energy than the hot water does coldness is caused by the absence of heat energy does when heat energy flows into the body that warms up the body and when it flows out of a body it cools the body now how to measure temperature when we touch an object we can say whether it is hot or cold the sense of touch can estimate the temperature but we cannot rely on the torch for the right measurement of temperature besides we shouldn't touch things which are very hot like the boiling water as you may get burn hands there are instruments to measure the temperature accurately which is the thermometer now the thermometer is used to measure temperature but what is the unit of time Richa just like we have different units to measure the length say inch centimetre metre extra we have different units to measure the temperature one of the unit of Temperature is degree Celsius like the temperature on a summer noon was 41 degrees celsius the normal temperature of human body is 37 degrees celsius when we have fever it means a body is hotter than the normal you must have seen or used the clinical thermometer used to measure the body temperature if you look closely you would find the scale starting from 94 till 108 hear essays written besides this k s stands for and height this is another unit of Temperature and a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit to see the structure of clinical thermometer it is made of long narrow uniform glass tube and it has a bulb at one and which carries the Mercury does Mercury expands when we put the thermometer in the mouth or underarms to measure the body temperature on expansion due to the high temperature the Mercury proceeds through the narrow tube like a thread know how to read the temperature look here the Mercury thread has crossed 100 into and has stopped at the third mark after it terrace APC the marking after 100 into the marking is 104 degrees so to degree is divided into 10 parts does each part is 2 divided by 10 which is equal to 0.2 degree Fahrenheit and does the third mark means 0.2 x 3 which is 0.6 so we can say the temperature is 102 degrees + 0.6 degrees witches 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit so we locate the fahrenheit scale on the thermometer to see where the Mercury thread ends and this is the temperature reading like here as show the reading Wars 102.6 degree fahrenheit now if we measure temperature in Celsius the normal body temperature is 37 degree centigrade in the clinical thermometer we can find the Celsius scale starting from 35 degree celsius to 42 degree Celsius 13 different types of thermometer besides the clinical thermometer one type of digital thermometer which doesn't use Mercury we just put the digital thermometer Spark in the mouth or under the arms or touch it with some object then the screen on it will show the temperature reading the digital thermometer is easier to use and measure the temperature accurately now you may wonder can we use clinical thermometer to measure the temperature of boiling water know the clinical thermometer is just suitable to measure body temperature the temperature of living person cannot be less than 94 degree fahrenheit when the body temperature is less than the normal it is called hypothermia and when the body temperature is above the normal range we call it fever increases in body temperature is called hyperthermia on the other hand and the chances of survival of a person are very less if the body temperature crosses 107 degrees Fahrenheit so the clinical thermometer has a scale from 94 degree Fahrenheit to 108 degree fahrenheit but the temperature of boiling water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degree Celsius so if you put the clinical thermometer in boiling water the Mercury would not get the space to stretch inside the thermometer and it would crack the thermometer with the pressure and hence the clinical thermometer is not used to measure the temperature of boiling water you know the laboratory thermometer has the longest Celsius scale and has it can be used to measure higher temperatures like 80 degree Celsius 100 degree Celsius and so on so remember children what is temperature the temperature indicates the degree of hotness or coldness of a body or a place and the temperature is measured in degree Celsius or degree fahrenheit and lastly different types of thermometers are used to measure the temperature that's all for now bye bye children

Reproduction in Plants
and (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual
reproduction plants can give rise to new
plants without seeds, whereas in sexual
reproduction, new plants are obtained
from seeds.
Paheli thought that new
me plants always grow from seeds.
But, she has never seen the seeds
of sugarcane, potato and rose. She
wants to know how these plants
reproduce.
lo produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms. You have already
learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
12.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? The flowers perform the function
of reproduction in plants. Flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. A
flower may have either the male part or
the female part or both male and female
parts.
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring. These are
categorised into two types: (i) asexual,
D
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds or
spores.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Sind
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.

cutting every day and observe its
growth. Observe and record the number

Fig. 12.1 Stem-cutting of rose
You must have seen flower buds
developing into flowers. Apart from
flower buds, there are buds in the axil
(point of attachment of the leaf at the
node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 12.2). A bud consists of a
short stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are folded. The
vegetative buds can also give rise to new
plants.
Activity 12.2
Take a fresh potato. Observe the scars
on it with the help of a magnifying glass.
You may find bud(s) in them. These scars
are also called “eyes”. Cut a few pieces

multiply every few hours if sufficient
nutrients are made available to them.
Remember that yeast is a single-celled
organism. Let us see how they
reproduce?
Activity 12.3
(To be demonstrated by the teacher)
Take a piece of yeast cake or yeast
powder from a bakery or a chemist shop.
Take a pinch of yeast and place it in a
container with some water. Add a
spoonful of sugar and shake to dissolve
it. Keep it in the warm part of a room.
After an hour, put a drop of this liquid
on a glass slide and observe under a
microscope. What do you observe? You
may see the formation of new yeast cells
(Fig. 12.5).
Boojho wants to know if
there is any advantage of
vegetative propagation.

Fig. 12.5 Reproduction in yeast by budding
Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.
REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS
135
Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

Spore formation
In Chapter 1 you learnt that the fungi
on a bread piece grow from spores which
are present in the air. Repeat Activity
1.2. Observe the spores in the cotton-
Sporangium
like mesh on the bread. When spores
are released they keep floating in the
air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

Activity 12.4
Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil.
The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.
Anther
Boojho wants to know how the
male gamete in the pollen grain
reaches the female gamete present

from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)
and (b)].

formation
gametes (to form a zygote) is called
fertilisation (Fig. 12.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
12.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango, apple and orange. Some fruits
are hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 12.12 (a) and (b)].
12.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.
Sometimes after a walk through a forest
or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

SCIENCE
Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

4.4 TRANSFER OF HEAT
You might have observed that a frying
pan becomes hot when kept on a flame.
It is because the heat passes from the
flame to the utensil. When the pan is
removed from the fire, it slowly cools
down. Why does it cool down? The heat
is transferred from the pan to the
surroundings. So you can understand
that in both cases, the heat flows from
a hotter object to a colder object. In fact,
transferred from the end nearest to the
flame to the other end?

This process continues till the whole
water gets heated. This mode of heat
transfer is known as convection.
How does the heat travel in air? In
which direction does the smoke go?
The air near the heat source gets hot
and rises. The air from the sides comes
in to take its place. In this way the air
gets heated. The following activity
confirms this idea.
Activity 4.9
Light a candle. Keep one hand above the
flame and one hand on the side of the
flame (Fig. 4.10). Do your hands feel
equally hot? If not which hand feels
hotter? And why?
Notice that towards the top, the air
gets heated by convection. Therefore, the
hand above the flame feels hot. On the
sides, however, there is no convection
and air does not feel as hot as at
the top.
The people living in the coastal areas
experience an interesting phenomenon.
During the day, the land gets heated
faster than the water. The air over the
land becomes hotter and rises up. The
cooler air from the sea rushes in towards
the land to take its place. The warm air
from the land moves towards the sea to
complete the cycle. The air from the sea
is called the sea breeze. To receive the
cooler sea breeze, the windows of the
houses in coastal areas are made to face
the sea. At night it is exactly the reverse
(Fig. 4.11). The water cools down more
slowly than the land. So, the cool air
from the land moves towards the sea.
This is called the land breeze. Fig. 4.11
shows this phenomenon.
When we come out in the sun, we
feel warm. How does the heat from the
sun reach us? It cannot reach us by
conduction or convection as there is no
medium such as air in most part of the

What you have learnt
Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness
of an object.
Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.
Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperatures.
Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature. The
range of this thermometer is from 35°C to 42°С. For other purposes, we
use the laboratory thermometers. The range of these thermometers is
usually from -10°C to 110°C.
The normal temperature of the human body is 37°C.
The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower
temperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from one
object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.
In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids
and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required
for transfer of heat by radiation.
The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are
conductors of heat.
The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are
called insulators.
Dark-coloured objects absorb radiation better than the light-coloured
objects. That is the reason we feel more comfortable in light-coloured
clothes in the summer.
Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is a
poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres.

these substances taste it now and enter
the result in Table 5.1.

to do so.
2. Do not touch anything unless asked

You find that some of these
substances taste sour, some taste bitter,
some taste sweet and some taste salty.
5.1 ACIDS AND BASES
Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and
vinegar taste sour. These substances
taste sour because they contain acids.
The chemical nature of such
substances is acidic. The word acid
comes from the Latin word acere which
means sour. The acids in these
substances are natural acids.
What about baking soda? Does it also
taste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since,
it does not taste sour it means, that it
has no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If
you rub its solution between fingers, it
feels soapy. Substances like these which
are bitter in taste and feel soapy on
touching are known as bases. The nature
of such substances is said to be basic.
If we cannot taste every substance,
how do we find its nature?
Special type of substances are used
to test whether a substance is acidic or
basic. These substances are known as
indicators. The indicators change their
colour when added to a solution
containing an acidic or a basic
substance. Turmeric, litmus, china rose
petals (Gudhal), etc., are some of the
naturally occurring indicators.

Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damaging
effect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is
called an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic
because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released
into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric
acid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,
historical monuments, plants and animals.
CAUTION
Great care should be taken while
handling laboratory acids and bases
because these are corrosive in nature,
irritating and harmful to skin.
Demonstrate the effect of the three
indicators on each of these solutions.
Record your observations in Table 5.5.
5.3 NEUTRALISATION
We have learnt that acids turn blue
litmus red and bases turn red litmus
blue. Let us see what happens when an
acid is mixed with a base.
We are going to use an indicator you
have not used so far. It is called
phenolphthalein.
Activity 5.5
To be demonstrated by the teacher in
the class
Fill one fourth of a test tube with dilute
hydrochloric acid. Note down its colour.
Note down the colour of phenolphthalein
solution also. Add 2–3 drops of the
indicator to the acid. Now shake the test
tube gently. Do you observe any change
in colour of the acid?
Add to the acidic solution a drop of
sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.
Stir the tube gently. Is there any change
in the colour of the solution? Continue
adding the sodium hydroxide solution
drop by drop while stirring till the pink
colour just appears.
Now add one more drop of dilute
hydrochloric acid. What do you observe?
The solution again becomes colourless.
Again add one drop of sodium
hydroxide solution. Is there any change
in colour? The solution again becomes
pink in colour.
It is evident that when the solution
is basic, phenolphthalein gives a pink
colour. On the other hand, when the
solution is acidic, it remains colourless.

SCIENCE
When an acidic solution is mixed
with a basic solution, both the solutions
neutralise the effect of each other. When
an acid solution and a base solution are
mixed in suitable amounts, both the
acidic nature of the acid and the basic
nature of the base are destroyed. The
resulting solution is neither acidic nor
basic. Touch the test tube immediately
after neutralisation. What do you
observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat
is always produced, or evolved. The
evolved heat raises the temperature of
the reaction mixture.
In neutralisation reaction a new
substance is formed. This is called salt.
Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral in
nature. Thus, neutralisation can be
defined as follows:
The reaction between an acid and
Salt+Water
a base is known as neutralisation. Salt
and water are produced in this process
with the evolution of heat.
Acid+Base Salt+Water
(Heat is evolved)
The following reaction is an example:

hydroxide (NaOH)

LIFE
have learnt in Chapter 2. But too
much of acid in the stomach causes
indigestion. Sometimes indigestion
is painful. To relieve indigestion, we
take an antacid such as milk of
magnesia, which contains magnesium
hydroxide. It neutralises the effect of
excessive acid.
Ant sting
The sting of an ant contains formic
acid. When an ant bites, it injects
the acidic liquid into the skin. The
effect of the sting can be neutralised by
rubbing moist baking soda (sodium
hydrogen carbonate) or calamine
solution, which contains zinc
carbonate.
Soil treatment
Excessive use of chemical fertilisers
makes the soil acidic. Plants do not grow
well when the soil is either too acidic or
too basic. When the soil is too acidic, it
is treated with bases like quick lime
(calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium
hydroxide). If the soil is basic, organic
matter is added to it. Organic matter
releases acids which neutralises the
basic nature of the soil.
Factory wastes
The wastes of many factories
contain acids. If they are allowed to
flow into the water bodies, the acids
will kill fish and other organisms.
The factory wastes are, therefore,
neutralised by adding basic
substances.

acid. It helps us to digest food, as you

What you have learnt
Acids are sour in taste. Bases are bitter in taste and soapy to touch.
Acid turns blue litmus red. Bases turn red litmus blue.
Substances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral.
Solutions of substances that show different colour in acidic, basic and
neutral solutions are called indicators.
An acid and a base neutralise each other and form a salt. A salt may be
acidic, basic or neutral in nature.

Physical and Chemical
Changes
A very day you come across many
changes in your surroundings.
These changes may involve one
or more substances. For example, your
mother may ask you to dissolve sugar
in water to make a cold drink. Making a
sugar solution is a change. Similarly,
setting curd from milk is a change.
Sometimes milk becomes sour. Souring
of milk is a change. Stretched rubber
band also represents a change.
Make a list of ten changes you have
noticed around you.
In this chapter we shall perform some
activities and study the nature of these
changes. Broadly, these changes are of
two kinds, physical and chemical.
6.1 PHYSICAL CHANGES
Activity 6.1
Cut a piece of paper in four square
pieces. Cut each square piece further
into four square pieces. Lay these pieces
on the floor or a table so that the pieces
acquire the shape of the original piece
of paper (Fig. 6.1).
Obviously, you cannot join the pieces
back to make the original piece, but is
there a change in the property of the
paper?
Activity 6.2
Collect the chalk dust lying on the floor
near the blackboard in your classroom.
Or, crush a small piece of chalk into
dust. Add a little water to the dust to
make a paste. Roll it into the shape of a
piece of chalk. Let it dry.
Did you recover chalk from the
dust?
Activity 6.3
Take some ice in a glass or plastic
tumbler. Melt a small portion of ice by
placing the tumbler in the sun. You have
now a mixture of ice and water. Now
place the tumbler in a freezing mixture
(ice plus common salt).
Does the water become solid ice once
again?
Fig. 6.1 Paper pieces
Activity 6.4
Boil some water in a container. Do you
see the steam rising from the surface of
water? Hold an inverted pan by its
handle over the steam at some distance
from the boiling water. Observe the
inner surface of the pan.
Do you see any droplet of water
there?
Activity 6.5
CAUTION
Be careful while handling a flame.
Hold a used hack-saw blade with a
pair of tongs. Keep the tip of the free
end on the flame of a gas stove. Wait for
a few minutes.
Does the colour of the tip of the blade
change?
Remove the blade from the flame.
Observe the tip once again after some
time.
Does it get back its original colour?
In Activities 6.1 and 6.2 above, you
saw that paper and a piece of chalk
underwent changes in size. In Activities
6.3 and 6.4, water changed its state (from
solid to liquid, or from gas to liquid). In
Activity 6.5, the hack-saw blade
changed colour on heating.
Properties such as shape, size, colour
and state of a substance are called its
physical properties. A change in which
a substance undergoes a change in its
physical properties is called a physical
change. A physical change is generally
reversible. In such a change no new
substance is formed.
Let us now consider the other kind
of change.
6.2 CHEMICAL CHANGE
A change with which you are quite
familiar is the rusting of iron. If you
leave a piece of iron in the open for some
time, it acquires a film of brownish
substance. This substance is called rust
and the process is called rusting
(Fig. 6.2). Iron gates of parks or
farmlands, iron benches kept in lawns
and gardens, almost every article of iron,
kept in the open gets rusted. At home
you must have seen shovels and spades
getting rusted when exposed to the

atmosphere for some time. In the
kitchen, a wet iron pan (tawa) often gets
rusted if left in that state for some time.
Rust is not iron. It is different from iron
on which it gets deposited.
Let us consider a few more changes
where new substances are formed.

teachers should advise children not
to stare at the burning ribbon.
light (Fig. 6.3). When it is completely
burnt it leaves behind a powdery ash.
Does the ash look like the
magnesium ribbon?
The change can be represented by
the following equation:
Magnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (0) ►
Magnesium oxide (Mgo)
The equations here are different from
those in mathematics. In equations
of this kind, the arrow implies
'becomes’. No attempt should be made
to balance chemical equations at this
stage.

ribbon of magnesium. Clean its tip with
sandpaper. Bring the tip near a candle

(aqueous solution) well. Test the mixture
with blue and red litmus papers.
Does the mixture turn red litmus
blue?
Does the mixture turn blue litmus
red?
On the basis of this test, how do you
classify the aqueous solution — acidic
or basic?
On dissolving the ash in water it
forms a new substance. This change can
be written in the form of the following
equation:
Magnesium oxide (MgO) + Water
(H,O) → Magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)]
As you have already learnt in
Chapter 5, magnesium hydroxide is a base.
So, magnesium oxide is a new substance
formed on burning of magnesium.
Magnesium hydroxide is another new

substance formed by mixing magnesium
oxide with water.
Activity 6.7
(To be demonstrated by the teacher)
Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper
sulphate (blue vitriol or neela thotha) in
about half a cup of water in a glass
tumbler or a beaker. Add a few drops of
dilute sulphuric acid to the solution.
You should get a blue coloured solution.
Save a small sample of the solution in a
test tube or a small glass bottle. Drop a
nail or a used shaving blade into the
remaining solution. Wait for half an
hour or so. Observe the colour of the
solution. Compare it with the colour of
the sample solution saved separately
(Fig. 6.4).
colour of the solution from blue to
green is due to the formation of iron
sulphate, a new substance. The brown
deposit on the iron nail is copper,
another new substance. We can write
the reaction as:
Copper Sulphate solution (blue) + Iron
→ Iron Sulphate solution (green)
+ Copper (brown deposit)
Activity 6.8
Take about a teaspoonful of vinegar in
a test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda
to it. You would hear a hissing sound
and see bubbles of a gas coming out.
Pass this gas through freshly prepared
lime water as shown in Fig. 6.5.

The changes that you notice are
due to a reaction between copper
sulphate and iron. The change of
The change in the test tube is as
follows:
Vinegar (Acetic acid) + Baking soda
(Sodium hydrogencarbonate) →
Carbon dioxide + other substances

Fig. 6.5 Set up to pass gas through lime water
Carbon dioxide (CO,) + Lime water
[Ca(OH),] → Calcium Carbonate
(CaCO3) + Water (HO)
When carbon dioxide is passed
through lime water, calcium carbonate
is formed, which makes lime water milky.
The turning of lime water into milky is a
standard test of carbon dioxide. You will
use it in Chapter 10 to show that the air
we breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide.
In Activities 6.6-6.8, you saw that
in each change one or more new
substances were formed. In Activity 6.6,
the ash was the new substance formed
when magnesium was burnt. In Activity 6.7,
the reaction of copper sulphate with iron
produced iron sulphate and copper.
Both of these are new substances.
Copper was deposited on the shaving
blade of iron. In Activity 6.8, vinegar and
baking soda together produced carbon
dioxide, which turned lime water milky.
Can you name the new substance
formed in this reaction?
A change in which one or more
new substances are formed is called a
chemical change. A chemical change
is also called a chemical reaction.
Chemical changes are very important
in our lives. All new substances are
formed as a result of chemical changes.
For example, if a metal is to be extracted
from an ore, such as iron from iron ore,
we need to carry out a series of chemical
changes. A medicine is the end product
of a chain of chemical reactions. Useful
new materials, such as plastics and
detergents, are produced by chemical
reactions. Indeed, every new material
is discovered by studying chemical
changes.
We have seen that one or more new
substances are produce in a chemical
change. In addition to new products,
the following may accompany a chemical
change:
Heat, light or any other radiation
(ultraviolet, for example) may be given
off or absorbed.
Sound may be produced.
A change in smell may take place or
a new smell may be given off.
• A colour change may take place .
• A gas may be formed.
Let us look at some examples.
You saw that burning of magnesium
ribbon is a chemical change. Burning
of coal, wood or leaves is also a chemical
change. In fact, burning of any
substance is a chemical change.
Burning is always accompanied by
production of heat.

weather may have a profound effect on
the game. It has a profound effect on
our lives. Many of our daily activities are
planned based on the weather predicted
for that day. There are daily reports of
the weather on the television and
radio and in the newspapers. But do you
know what this weather really is?
In this chapter, we will study about
the weather and climate. We will also
see how different forms of life are
adapted to the climate of their habitat.
7.1 WEATHER
In Fig. 7.1 a sample of weather report
from a newspaper is given.
We find that the daily weather report

*(Rainfall may not be recorded for all the days since it may not rain everyday. Leave
the space for rainfall blank if the data is not available.)
Rainfall is measured by an
instrument called the rain gauge. It
is basically a measuring cylinder with
a funnel on top to collect rainwater
Do all the seven days have the same
maximum and minimum temperatures,
humidity and rainfall? The maximum
and minimum temperatures recorded
may be the same for some of the days.
However, all the parameters are not the
same on any two days. Over a week there
may be considerable variation. The day-
to-day condition of the atmosphere
at a place with respect to the
temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-
speed, etc., is called the weather at that
place. The temperature, humidity, and
other factors are called the elements of
the weather. The weather of a place
changes day after day and week after
week. That is why we often say, “today's
weather is too humid"", or ""the weather
was warm last week”.
The weather is such a complex
phenomenon that it can vary over very
short periods of time. It can happen
sometimes that it is sunny in the
morning, but suddenly clouds appear
from nowhere and it starts raining
heavily. Or, a heavy rain may vanish in
a matter of minutes and give way to
bright sunshine. You must have had
several such experiences. Try to recall
any such experience and share it with
your friends. Since weather is such a
complex phenomenon, it is not easy to
predict.

As it is clear from any weather report
the maximum and minimum
temperatures are recorded every day. Do
you know how these temperatures are
recorded. In Chapter 4 you have learnt
that there are special thermometers for
this purpose, called maximum and
minimum thermometers. Can you
guess when during the day we have the
maximum temperature and when the
minimum?
The maximum temperature of the day
occurs generally in the afternoon while
the minimum temperature occurs
generally in the early morning. Can you
now understand why in summers we feel
so miserable in the afternoon and
comparatively comfortable early in the
morning?
I wonder why weather
changes so frequently!
What is the source of weather
7 in the first place?
All changes in the weather are caused by the sun. The sun is a huge sphere of
hot gases at a very high temperature. The distance of the sun from us is very
large. Even then the energy sent out by the sun is so huge that it is the source of
all heat and light on the earth. So, the sun is the primary source of energy that
causes changes in the weather. Energy absorbed and reflected by the earth's
surface, oceans and the atmosphere play important roles in determining the
weather at any place. If you live near the sea, you would have realised that the
weather at your place is different from that of a place in a desert, or near a mountain.

SCIENCE
What about the times of sunrise and
sunset? You know that in winters it
becomes dark early and you do not get
much time to play. Are the days shorter
in winter than in summer? Try to find
it out yourself by completing the project
given at the end of the chapter.
7.2 CLIMATE
Meteorologists record the weather every
day. The records of the weather have
been preserved for the past several
decades. These help us to determine the
weather pattern at a place. The average
weather pattern taken over a long
time, say 25 years, is called the
climate of the place. If we find that
the temperature at a place is high most
of the time, then we say that the climate
of that place is hot. If there is also heavy
rainfall on most of the days in the same
place, then we can say that the climate
of that place is hot and wet.
In Table 7.2 and 7.3, we have given
the climatic condition at two places in
India. The mean temperature for a given
month is found in two steps. First we
find the average of the temperatures
recorded during the month. Second, we
calculate the average of such average
temperatures over many years. That
gives the mean temperature. The two
places are: Srinagar in Jammu and
Kashmir, and Thiruvananthapuram in
Kerala.

WEATHER, CLIMATE AND ADAPTATIONS OF ANIMALS TO CLIMATE
71
By looking at Tables 7.2 and 7.3 we
can easily see the difference in the
climate of Jammu & Kashmir and
Kerala. We can see that Kerala is very
hot and wet in comparison to Jammu
& Kashmir, which has a moderately hot
and wet climate for a part of the year.
Similar data for the western region
of India, for example Rajasthan, will
show that the temperature is high
during most part of the year. But during
winter, which lasts only for a few
months, the temperature is quite low.
This region receives very little
rainfall. This is the typical desert
climate. It is hot and dry. The north-
eastern India receives rain for a major
part of the year. Therefore, we can say
that the climate of the north-east is wet.
7.3 CLIMATE AND ADAPTATION
Climate has a profound effect on all
living organisms.
Animals are adapted to survive in the
conditions in which they live. Animals
living in very cold and hot climate must
possess special features to protect
themselves against the extreme cold or
heat. Recall from Chapter 9 of your
Class VI science book the definition of
adaptation. Features and habits that
help animals to adapt to their
surroundings are a result of the process
of evolution.
In Chapter 9 you will learn about the
effect of weather and climate on soil.
Here we study the effect of climate on
animals only. In Class VI, you have read
about adaptations of animals to certain
habitats. As examples of adaptation of
animals to climatic conditions, we
discuss only animals living in polar
regions and tropical rainforests.
As the name suggests, the polar
regions are situated near the poles, i.e.,
north pole and south pole.
Some well-known countries that
belong to the polar regions are Canada,
Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Alaska in U.S.A. and Siberian
region of Russia.
Examples of some countries where
the tropical rainforests are found are
India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil,
Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and
Nigeria.
Activity 7.2
Take an outline map of the world. Mark
the polar regions in blue. Similarly,
mark the tropical regions in red.
(i) The polar regions
The polar regions present an extreme
climate. These regions are covered with
snow and it is very cold for most part of
the year. For six months the sun does
not set at the poles while for the other
six months the sun does not rise. In
winters, the temperature can be as low
as -37°C. Animals living there have
adapted to these severe conditions. Let
us see how they are adapted by
considering the examples of polar bears
and penguins.
Polar bears have white fur so that
they are not easily visible in the snowy
white background. It protects them from
72
SCIENCE
Another well-known animal living in
the polar regions is the penguin
(Fig. 7.4). It is also white and merges
well with the white background. It also
has a thick skin and a lot of fat to protect
it from cold. You may have seen pictures
of penguins huddled together. This they
do to keep warm. Recall how warm you
feel when you are in a hall full of people.
their predators. It also helps them in
catching their prey. To protect them
from extreme cold, they have two thick
layers of fur. They also have a layer of
fat under their skin. In fact, they are so
well-insulated that they have to move
slowly and rest often to avoid getting
overheated.
Physical activities on warm days
necessitate cooling. So, the polar bear
goes for swimming. It is a good
swimmer. Its paws are wide and large,
which help it not only to swim well but
also walk with ease in the snow. While
swimming under water, it can close its
nostrils and can remain under water for
long durations. It has a strong sense of
smell so that it can catch its prey
for food. We can understand the
adaptations of polar bears with the help
of the flow chart shown in Fig. 7.3.

long, birds must remain warm to
survive. They migrate to warmer regions
when winter sets in. They come back
after the winter is over. You know
probably that India is one of the
destinations of many of these birds. You
must have seen or heard about the
Siberian crane that comes from Siberia
to places like Bharatpur in Rajasthan
and Sultanpur in Haryana, and some
Fig. 7.5 Feet of penguin
Like polar bears, penguins are also good
swimmers. Their bodies are streamlined
and their feet have webs, making them
good swimmers (Fig. 7.5).
Other animals living in the polar
regions are many types of fishes, musk
oxen, reindeers, foxes, seals, whales,
and birds. It is to be noted that while
fish can remain under cold water for
Do fishes and butterflies
also migrate like birds?
Fig. 7.6 Migratory birds

birds in flight
Did you know?
Some migratory birds travel as much as 15000 km to escape the extreme climatic
conditions at home. Generally they fly high where the wind flow is helpful and
the cold conditions allow them to disperse the heat generated by their flight
muscles. But how these birds travel to the same place year after year is still a
mystery. It seems that these birds have a built-in sense of direction and know in
which direction to travel. Some birds probably use landmarks to guide them. Many
birds may be guided by the sun during the day and stars at night. There is some
evidence that birds may use the magnetic field of the earth to find direction. And
it is not only birds that migrate; mammals, many types of fish and insects are
also known to migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates.

wetlands of north east and some other
parts of India (Fig. 7.6).
(ii) The tropical rainforests
The tropical region has generally a hot
climate because of its location around
the equator. Even in the coldest month
the temperature is generally higher than
about 15°C. During hot summers, the
temperature may cross 40°C. Days and
nights are almost equal in length
throughout the year. These regions get
plenty of rainfall. An important feature
of this region is the tropical rainforests.
Tropical rainforests are found in
Western Ghats and Assam in India,
Southeast Asia, Central America and
Central Africa. Because of continuous
warmth and rain, this region supports
wide variety of plants and animals. The
major types of animals living in the
rainforests are monkeys, apes, gorillas,
lions, tigers, elephants, leopards, lizards,
snakes, birds and insects.
Let us read about the adaptations of
these animals to a hot, humid climate.
The climatic conditions in rainforests
are highly suitable for supporting an
enormous number and variety of
animals.
Since the numbers are large, there
is intense competition for food and
shelter. Many animals are adapted to
living on the trees. Red-eyed frog
(Fig. 7.7) has developed sticky pads on
its feet to help it climb trees on which it
lives. To help them live on the trees,
monkeys (Fig. 7.8) have long tails for
grasping branches. Their hands and feet
Fig. 7.8 A new world monkey
are such that they can easily hold on to
the branches.
As there is competition for food, some
animals are adapted to get food not
easily reachable. A striking example is
that of the bird Toucan (Fig. 7.9), which
possesses a long, large beak. This helps
a toucan to reach the fruits on branches
which are otherwise too weak to support
its weight.
Many tropical animals have sensitive
hearing, sharp eyesight, thick skin and
a skin colour which helps them to
camouflage by blending with the
surroundings. This is to protect them
from predators. For example, big cats

(Fig. 7.11). It has adapted to the
conditions of rainforests in many
remarkable ways. Look at its trunk. It
uses it as a nose because of which it
has a strong sense of smell. The trunk
is also used by it for picking up food.
Moreover, its tusks are modified teeth.
These can tear the bark of trees that
elephant loves to eat. So, the elephant
is able to handle the competition for food
rather well. Large ears of the elephant
help it to hear even very soft sounds.
They also help the elephant to keep cool
in the hot and humid climate of the
rainforest.

macaque
(lions and tigers) have thick skins and
sensitive hearing.
The lion-tailed macaque (also called
Beard ape) lives in the rainforests of
f
Western Ghats (Fig. 7.10). Its most
outstanding feature is the silver-white
mane, which surrounds the head from
the cheeks down to its chin. It is a good
climber and spends a major part of its
life on the tree. It feeds mainly on fruits.
It also eats seeds, young leaves, stems,
flowers and buds. This beard ape also
searches for insects under the bark of
the trees. Since it is able to get sufficient
food on the trees, it rarely comes down
on the ground.
Another well-known animal of Indian
tropical rainforest is the elephant

What you have learnt
The day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to
the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-speed, etc., is called the
weather at that place.
The weather is generally not the same on any two days and week after
week.
The maximum temperature of the day occurs generally in the afternoon
while the minimum temperature occurs in the early morning.
The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year.
All the changes in the weather are driven by the sun.
The average weather pattern taken over a long time, say 25 years, is
called the climate of the place.
The tropical and the polar regions are the two regions of the earth,
which have severe climatic conditions.
Animals are adapted to the conditions in which they live.
The polar regions are very cold throughout the year. The sun does not
set for six months in a year and in the other six months it does not rise.
Animals in the polar region are adapted to the extremely cold climate by
having some special characteristics such as white fur, strong sense of
smell, a layer of fat under the skin, wide and large paws for swimming
and walking, etc.
Migration is another means to escape the harsh, cold conditions.
Because of the hospitable climatic conditions huge populations of plants
and animals are found in the tropical rainforests.
Animals in the tropical rainforests are adapted such that they eat
different kinds of food to overcome the competition for food and shelter.
Some adaptations of animals living in the tropical rainforests include
living on the trees, development of strong tails, long and large beaks,
bright colours, sharp patterns, loud voice, diet of fruits, sensitive hearing,
sharp eyesight, thick skin, ability to camouflage in order to protect
themselves from predators, etc.

Winds, Storms and Cyclones
rissa was hit by a cyclone with
wind speed of 200 km/h on
18 October 1999. The cyclone
smashed 45,000 houses making
7,00,000 people homeless. On
29 October the same year, a second
cyclone with wind speed of 260 km/h
hit Orissa again. It was accompanied by
water waves about 9 m high. Thousands
of people lost their lives. Property worth
crores of rupees was destroyed. The
cyclone affected agriculture, transport,
communication, and electricity supply.
But, what are cyclones? How are
they formed? Why are they so
destructive? In this chapter we shall
seek answers to some of these questions.
We begin with some activities
involving air. These activities will clarify
some basic features concerning a
cyclone. Before we begin, remember that
the moving air is called the wind.
8.1 AIR EXERTS PRESSURE
Activity 8.1
Whenever an activity involves heating,
be very careful. It is advised that such
activities are performed in the
presence of an elderly person from
your family. Or, carry out these
activities in the presence of your
teacher.
You need to boil water in the following
activity.
Take a tin can with a lid. Fill it
approximately half with water. Heat the
can on a candle flame till the water boils.
Let the water boil for a few minutes. Blow
out the candle. Immediately put the lid
tightly on the can. Be careful in handling
the hot can. Put the can carefully in a
shallow metallic vessel or a washbasin.
Pour fresh water over the can.
What happens to the shape of the can?

is blowing. You can list some more
experiences which show that the air has
pressure.
Let us now try to explain why the
can (or the bottle) gets distorted. As
water is poured over the can, some
steam in the can condenses into water,
reducing the amount of air inside. The
pressure of air inside the can decreases
than the pressure exerted by the air
from outside the can. As a result the
can gets compressed.
This activity again confirms that air
exerts pressure.

Activity 8.2
Fig. 8.2 Can with hot water being cooled
Can you guess why the shape of the
can gets distorted?
If you cannot get a tin can, take a
soft plastic bottle. Fill it with hot water.
Empty the bottle and immediately cap
it tightly. Place the bottle under running
water.
Recall now some of your experiences.
When you fly a kite, does the wind
coming from your back help?
If you are in a boat, is it easier to
row it if there is wind coming from
behind you?
Do you find it difficult to ride a bicycle
against the direction of the wind.
You know that we have to fill air into
the bicycle tube to keep it tight. Also,
you know that a bicycle tube overfilled
with air may burst. What is the air doing
inside the tube?
Discuss with your friends how the
air in the bicycle tube keeps it in shape.
All these experiences show that the
air exerts pressure. It is due to this
pressure that the leaves of trees,
banners, or flags flutter when the wind

tie each one to a string. Hang the
balloons 8-10 cm apart on a cycle spoke
or a stick. Blow in the space between
the balloons.
What did you expect? What
happens?
Try different ways of blowing on the
balloons to see what happens.
Activity 8.4
Can you blow and lift?
Hold a strip of paper, 20 cm long and
3 cm wide, between your thumb and
forefinger as shown in the Fig. 8.5. Now
blow over the paper.
What do you think will happen to
the paper?
Let us try to understand the
observations in Activities 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.
Were the observations along the lines
you thought? Do you get the feeling
that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure?
When we blow into the mouth of the
bottle, the air near the mouth has higher
speed. This decreases the pressure
there. The air pressure inside the bottle
is higher than near the mouth. The air
inside the bottle pushes the ball out.
In Activity 8.3 you saw that when you
blew between the balloons, they moved

Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.
8.4 WIND CURRENTS ARE GENERATED
DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON
THE EARTH
These situations are:
(a) Uneven heating between
the equator and the poles
You might have learnt in Geography that
regions close to the equator get
maximum heat from the Sun. The air
in these regions gets warm. The warm
air rises, and the cooler air from the

regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.
(b) Uneven heating of land
and water
You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).
The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam', which means
‘season'.
In winter, the direction of the wind
flow gets reversed; it flows from the land
to the ocean (Fig. 8.10).

winds do for us.

I wonder why the winds shown

The winds from the oceans carry
water and bring rain. It is a part of the
water cycle.
The monsoon winds carry water
and it rains.
Clouds bring rain and give us
happiness. Farmers in our country
depend mainly on rains for their
harvests. There are many folk songs
associated with clouds and rain. Sing
and enjoy with your friends, if you know
such a song. Here is one for you.
The winds would have flown in the
north-south direction from north to
south, or from south to north. A change
in direction is however, caused by the
rotation of the earth.

SCIENCE
8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.

that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

Extended Learning – Activities and Projects
1. You can perform the Activity 8.5 in the chapter slight
differently at home. Use two plastic bottles of the same size. Stretch one
balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.
2. You can make your own anemometer.
Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

• Do you see layers of particles of

The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different
layers of the soil is called the soil profile.

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

When all the water has percolated

rate of percolation by using the
following formula:

evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.
9.6 ABSORPTION OF WATER BY SOIL
Do all the soils absorb water to the same
extent? Let us find out.
Activity 9.6
Take a plastic funnel. Take a filter paper
(or a piece of newspaper sheet), fold and
place it as shown in the figure. Weigh
50g of dry, powdered soil and pour it
into the funnel. Measure a certain
amount of water in a measuring cylinder
and pour it drop by drop on the soil.
You can use a dropper for this purpose.
Do not let all the water fall at one spot.

more rain water percolate and reach
the water underground?
9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

What you have learnt
Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.

SCIENCE
Soil holds water in it, which is called soil moisture. The capacity of a soil
to hold water is important for various crops.
Clayey soil is used to make pots, toys and statues.

hours. This activity is best done in the afternoon. Take care that the
soil does not spill outside the newspaper. After drying it, weigh the soil
again. The difference in the weight of the soil before and after drying
gives you the amount of moisture contained in 100 g of soil. This is
called the percentage moisture content.

Have you ever wondered why you get
muscle cramps after heavy exercise? The
cramps occur when muscle cells respire
anaerobically. The partial breakdown of
glucose produces lactic acid. The
accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle
cramps. We get relief from cramps after a
hot water bath or a massage. Can you
guess why it is so? Hot water bath or
massage improves circulation of blood.
As a result, the supply of oxygen to the
muscle cells increases. The increase in
the supply of oxygen results in the
complete breakdown of lactic acid into
carbon dioxide and water.

rate of breathing will be the slowest and
in which it will be the fastest? Assign
numbers to the pictures in the order of
increasing rate of breathing according
to your experience.
10.3 How Do WE BREATHE?
Let us now learn about the mechanism
of breathing. Normally we take in air
through our nostrils. When we inhale
air, it passes through our nostrils into
the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity,
the air reaches our lungs through the
windpipe. Lungs are present in the
chest cavity (Fig. 10.4). This cavity is
surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,
muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 10.4).
Breathing involves the movement of the
diaphragm and the rib cage.
During inhalation, ribs move up and
outwards and diaphragm moves down.
This movement increases space in our
chest cavity and air rushes into the
lungs. The lungs get filled with air.
During exhalation, ribs move down and
inwards, while diaphragm moves up to
its former position. This reduces the size
of the chest cavity and air is pushed out
of the lungs (Fig. 10.5). These
movements in our body can be felt

The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust,
pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the
nasal cavity. Then they irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we
sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-
free, clean air enters our body.
TAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign
particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.

These openings are called spiracles
(Fig. 10.9). Insects have a network of air
tubes called tracheae for gas exchange.
Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles
into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the
body tissue, and reaches every cell of
the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from
the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and
moves out through spiracles. These air
tubes or tracheae are found only in
insects and not in any other group of

plants each part can independently take
in oxygen from the air and give out
carbon dioxide. You have already learnt

exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

of the skin. You may wonder how gills
help in breathing. Gills are well supplied
with blood vessels (Fig. 10.10) for
exchange of gases.
Like all other living cells of the
plants, the root cells also need
oxygen to generate energy. Roots take

What you have learnt
Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms. It releases energy
from the food.
The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide
and water. Energy is released in the process.
The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellular
respiration).
If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic
respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the
respiration is called anaerobic respiration.
During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is
insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.
Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an
organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon
dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different
organisms.
During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original
state as the air moves out during exhalation.
Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.
In animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and the
process of breathing are similar to those in humans.
In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In
fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.
In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores
called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of
glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings.

1. Observe fish in an aquarium. You will find flap like structures on both
sides of their heads. These are flaps which cover the gills. These flaps
open and close alternately. On the basis of these observations, explain
the process of respiration in the fish.
2. Visit a local doctor. Learn about the harmful effects of smoking. You can
also collect material on this topic from other sources. You can seek help
of your teacher or parents. Find out the percentage of people of your
area who smoke. If you have a smoker in your family, confront him with
the material that you have collected.
3. Visit a doctor. Find out about artificial respiration. Ask the doctor:
(a) When does a person need artificial respiration?
(b) Does the person need to be kept on artificial respiration tempo
rarily or permanently?
cFrom where can the person get supply of oxygen for artificial res
piration?
4. Measure the breathing rate of the members of your family and some of
your friends. Investigate:
(c) If the breathing rate of children is different from that of adults.
(d) If the breathing rate of males is different from that of females.
If there is a difference in any of these cases, try to find the reason.

Did you know?
For us oxygen is essential, but for those organisms which do not use it,
oxygen is toxic. In fact, our white blood cells use oxygen to kill invading
bacteria. Even for humans, it may be dangerous to breathe pure oxygen
for long.

SCIENCE
Transportation in Animals
and Plants
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 11.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in plants and animals.
11.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Heart

Artery
Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is a liquid, which has
cells of various kinds suspended in it.
Ella
Why is the colour of
blood red?
Fig. 11.1 Circulatory system
(Arteries are shown in red colour and vein in blue)
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.
Activity 11.1
The fluid part of the blood is called
plasma.
One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin bind
with oxygen and transports it to all the
parts of the body and ultimately to all
the cells. It will be difficult to provide
oxygen efficiently to all the cells of
the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 10. So, two types of
blood vessels are present in the arteries
and veins of the body. (Fig. 11.1)
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 11.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.

I am confused! I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygen-rich blood.
2010
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart.
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.

Refer to Fig. 11.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels. On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join up to
form veins which empty into the heart.
Heart
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 11.1). Hold your
fingers inwards on your palm. That

makes your fist. Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four
chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 11.4). The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

SCIENCE
to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your
heart by listening through a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.
Activity 11.2
Take a small funnel of 6-7 cm in
diameter. Fix a rubber tube (50 cm long)
tightly on the stem of the funnel. Stretch

near the heart. Now try to listen
carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heartbeats. How many times did your
heartbeat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4-5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and
heartbeat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 11.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heartbeat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heartbeat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not posses any
circulatory system. The water in which
they live brings food and oxygen as it
enters their bodies. The water carries
away waste materials and carbon dioxide
as it moves out. Thus, these animals do
not need a circulatory fluid like the
blood.
Let us now learn about the remova
of waste other than carbon dioxide.
11.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells perform their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion forms the excretory system.
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578-1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called “circulator”. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harvey's idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.

Kidney
contains water and salts. Boojho has
seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat.
Does sweat serve any other function?
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot, which causes cooling.
Ureter
Paheli wants to know
whether other animals also
urinate?
Urinary bladder

The way in which waste chemicals are
removed from the body of the animal
depends on the availability of water.
Aquatic animals like fishes, excrete cell
waste in gaseous form (ammonia)
which directly dissolves in water. Some
land animals like birds, lizards,
snakes excrete a semi-solid, white
coloured compound (uric acid). The
major excretory product in humans
is urea.
tube-like ureters. It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 11.6).
The kindeys, ureters, bladder and
urethra form the excretory system.
An adult human being normally
passes about 1-1.8 L of urine in 24
hours, and the urine consists of 95%
water, 2.5 % urea and 2.5% other waste
products.
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day. The sweat
Sometimes a person's kidneys may
stop working due to infection or
injury. As a result of kidney failure,
waste products start accumulating in
the blood. Such persons cannot
survive unless their blood is filtered
periodically through an artificial
kidney. This process is called dialysis.

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 11.7 (b)].

level of sugar solution. How did water
get inside the potato? For very short
distances water can move from one cell

reaches xylem vessels of the root from

Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants release
a lot of water by the process of
transpiration.
Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil. Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant. The
water evaporates through the stomata

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products to
different parts of the body for excretion.
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.
In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.
Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.
The human heart beats about 70-80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a
urinary bladder, and urethra.
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.

Fish excrete waste substances which directly dissolve in water.
Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.

The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the

What you have learnt
The day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to
the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-speed, etc., is called the
weather at that place.
The weather is generally not the same on any two days and week after
week.
The maximum temperature of the day occurs generally in the afternoon
while the minimum temperature occurs in the early morning.
The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year.
All the changes in the weather are driven by the sun.
The average weather pattern taken over a long time, say 25 years, is
called the climate of the place.
The tropical and the polar regions are the two regions of the earth,
which have severe climatic conditions.
Animals are adapted to the conditions in which they live.
The polar regions are very cold throughout the year. The sun does not
set for six months in a year and in the other six months it does not rise.
Animals in the polar region are adapted to the extremely cold climate by
having some special characteristics such as white fur, strong sense of
smell, a layer of fat under the skin, wide and large paws for swimming
and walking, etc.
Migration is another means to escape the harsh, cold conditions.
Because of the hospitable climatic conditions huge populations of plants
and animals are found in the tropical rainforests.
Animals in the tropical rainforests are adapted such that they eat
different kinds of food to overcome the competition for food and shelter.
Some adaptations of animals living in the tropical rainforests include
living on the trees, development of strong tails, long and large beaks,
bright colours, sharp patterns, loud voice, diet of fruits, sensitive hearing,
sharp eyesight, thick skin, ability to camouflage in order to protect
themselves from predators, etc.

Winds, Storms and Cyclones
rissa was hit by a cyclone with
wind speed of 200 km/h on
18 October 1999. The cyclone
smashed 45,000 houses making
7,00,000 people homeless. On
29 October the same year, a second
cyclone with wind speed of 260 km/h
hit Orissa again. It was accompanied by
water waves about 9 m high. Thousands
of people lost their lives. Property worth
crores of rupees was destroyed. The
cyclone affected agriculture, transport,
communication, and electricity supply.
But, what are cyclones? How are
they formed? Why are they so
destructive? In this chapter we shall
seek answers to some of these questions.
We begin with some activities
involving air. These activities will clarify
some basic features concerning a
cyclone. Before we begin, remember that
the moving air is called the wind.
8.1 AIR EXERTS PRESSURE
Activity 8.1
Whenever an activity involves heating,
be very careful. It is advised that such
activities are performed in the
presence of an elderly person from
your family. Or, carry out these
activities in the presence of your
teacher.
You need to boil water in the following
activity.
Take a tin can with a lid. Fill it
approximately half with water. Heat the
can on a candle flame till the water boils.
Let the water boil for a few minutes. Blow
out the candle. Immediately put the lid
tightly on the can. Be careful in handling
the hot can. Put the can carefully in a
shallow metallic vessel or a washbasin.
Pour fresh water over the can.
What happens to the shape of the can?

is blowing. You can list some more
experiences which show that the air has
pressure.
Let us now try to explain why the
can (or the bottle) gets distorted. As
water is poured over the can, some
steam in the can condenses into water,
reducing the amount of air inside. The
pressure of air inside the can decreases
than the pressure exerted by the air
from outside the can. As a result the
can gets compressed.
This activity again confirms that air
exerts pressure.

ACCOMPANIED BY REDUCED AIR
PRESSURE
Activity 8.2
Fig. 8.2 Can with hot water being cooled
Can you guess why the shape of the
can gets distorted?
If you cannot get a tin can, take a
soft plastic bottle. Fill it with hot water.
Empty the bottle and immediately cap
it tightly. Place the bottle under running
water.
Recall now some of your experiences.
When you fly a kite, does the wind
coming from your back help?
If you are in a boat, is it easier to
row it if there is wind coming from
behind you?
Do you find it difficult to ride a bicycle
against the direction of the wind.
You know that we have to fill air into
the bicycle tube to keep it tight. Also,
you know that a bicycle tube overfilled
with air may burst. What is the air doing
inside the tube?
Discuss with your friends how the
air in the bicycle tube keeps it in shape.
All these experiences show that the
air exerts pressure. It is due to this
pressure that the leaves of trees,
banners, or flags flutter when the wind

a ball of size smaller than the mouth of

inside its mouth. Now try to blow on

the activity with bottles of different sizes.

Take two balloons of approximately
equal size. Put a little water into the

tie each one to a string. Hang the
balloons 8-10 cm apart on a cycle spoke
or a stick. Blow in the space between
the balloons.
What did you expect? What
happens?
Try different ways of blowing on the
balloons to see what happens.
Activity 8.4
Can you blow and lift?
Hold a strip of paper, 20 cm long and
3 cm wide, between your thumb and
forefinger as shown in the Fig. 8.5. Now
blow over the paper.
What do you think will happen to
the paper?
Let us try to understand the
observations in Activities 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.
Were the observations along the lines
you thought? Do you get the feeling
that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure?
When we blow into the mouth of the
bottle, the air near the mouth has higher
speed. This decreases the pressure
there. The air pressure inside the bottle
is higher than near the mouth. The air
inside the bottle pushes the ball out.
In Activity 8.3 you saw that when you

candle below one of the bags as shown
in the figure. Observe what happens.
Why is the balance of the bags
disturbed?
Does this activity indicate that warm
air rises up? As the warm air rises up,
it pushes the bag above the candle. Does
the disturbance of the balance suggest
that the warm air is lighter than the cold
air?
Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.
8.4 WIND CURRENTS ARE GENERATED
DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON
THE EARTH
These situations are:
(a) Uneven heating between
the equator and the poles
You might have learnt in Geography that
regions close to the equator get
maximum heat from the Sun. The air
in these regions gets warm. The warm
air rises, and the cooler air from the

SCIENCE
regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.
(b) Uneven heating of land
and water
You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).
The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam', which means
‘season'.
In winter, the direction of the wind
flow gets reversed; it flows from the land
to the ocean (Fig. 8.10).

I want to know what these
winds do for us.
u

uneven heating on the earth
I wonder why the winds shown
in the figure are not in the exact
north-south direction.
The winds from the oceans carry
water and bring rain. It is a part of the
water cycle.
The monsoon winds carry water
and it rains.
Clouds bring rain and give us
happiness. Farmers in our country
depend mainly on rains for their
harvests. There are many folk songs
associated with clouds and rain. Sing
and enjoy with your friends, if you know
such a song. Here is one for you.
The winds would have flown in the
north-south direction from north to
south, or from south to north. A change
in direction is however, caused by the
rotation of the earth.

However, it is not always a happy
ending. Rains often create problems.
Can you list some of the problems?
You can discuss the causes and
solutions of the problems with your
teacher and parents.
In nature itself there are certain
situations that can sometimes create
disasters and pose threat to humans,
animals and plant life.
Let's study two such situations —
thunderstorms and cyclones.

SCIENCE
8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.
The following flow chart will help you to understand the phenomena
that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

1. You can perform the Activity 8.5 in the chapter slight
differently at home. Use two plastic bottles of the same size. Stretch one
balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.
2. You can make your own anemometer.
Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

Soil is composed of distinct layers.
Perform the following activity to find out
how these layers are arranged.
Activity 9.2
• Do you see layers of particles of
different sizes in the glass tumbler?
· Draw a diagram showing these layers.
Are there some dead rotting leaves
or animal remains floating on water?
The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different
layers of the soil is called the soil profile.
Each layer differs in feel (texture),

the soil profile at that place. Soil profile
can also be seen while digging a well or
laying the foundation of a building. It
can also be seen at the sides of a road
on a hill or at a steep river bank.
The uppermost horizon is generally

and minerals. The humus makes the

compact and is called the B-horizon or

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has

growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

9.4 PROPERTIES OF SOIL
You have listed some uses of soil. Let us
perform some activities to find the
characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

the time when you start pouring water.
When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time
again. Be careful not to let the water
spill over or run down on the outside of
the pipe while pouring. Calculate the
rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)
percolation time (min)
For example, suppose that for a
certain sample, it took 20 minutes for
200 mL to percolate. So,
on 200 mL
rate of percolation = = 10 mL/min
“ 20 min
Calculate the rate of percolation in
your soil sample. Compare your findings
with others and arrange the soil samples
in the increasing order of the rate of
percolation.
9.5 MOISTURE IN SOIL
Have you ever passed through a
farmland during a hot summer day?
Perhaps you noticed that the air above
the land is shimmering. Why is it so?
Try out this activity and find the answer.
Activity 9.5
Take a boiling tube. Put two spoonfulls
of a soil sample in it. Heat it on a flame
(Fig. 9.6) and observe it. Let us find out
what happens upon heating.
Do you see water drops any where?
If yes, where did you find them?
On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.
9.6 ABSORPTION OF WATER BY SOIL
Do all the soils absorb water to the same
extent? Let us find out.
Activity 9.6
Take a plastic funnel. Take a filter paper
(or a piece of newspaper sheet), fold and
place it as shown in the figure. Weigh
50g of dry, powdered soil and pour it
into the funnel. Measure a certain
amount of water in a measuring cylinder
and pour it drop by drop on the soil.
You can use a dropper for this purpose.
Do not let all the water fall at one spot.

samples. Would you get the same results
for all the samples? Discuss the results
with your friends and answer the
following question:

percolation rate?
Which soil would have the lowest
percolation rate?
• Boojho heard from his neighbourer
that 8–10 days after the rain, the level
of water in a pond or well rises. Which
type of soil will allow water to reach
a well faster and in greater amount?
Which type of soil retains the highest
amount of water and which retains
the least?
. Can you suggest any method to let
more rain water percolate and reach
the water underground?
9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.

hours. This activity is best done in the afternoon. Take care that the
soil does not spill outside the newspaper. After drying it, weigh the soil
again. The difference in the weight of the soil before and after drying
gives you the amount of moisture contained in 100 g of soil. This is
called the percentage moisture content.

accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle
cramps. We get relief from cramps after a
hot water bath or a massage. Can you
guess why it is so? Hot water bath or
massage improves circulation of blood.
As a result, the supply of oxygen to the

the supply of oxygen results in the
complete breakdown of lactic acid into
carbon dioxide and water.

increasing rate of breathing according
to your experience.
10.3 How Do WE BREATHE?
Let us now learn about the mechanism
of breathing. Normally we take in air
through our nostrils. When we inhale
air, it passes through our nostrils into
the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity,
the air reaches our lungs through the
windpipe. Lungs are present in the
chest cavity (Fig. 10.4). This cavity is
surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,
muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 10.4).
Breathing involves the movement of the
diaphragm and the rib cage.
During inhalation, ribs move up and
outwards and diaphragm moves down.
This movement increases space in our
chest cavity and air rushes into the
lungs. The lungs get filled with air.
During exhalation, ribs move down and
inwards, while diaphragm moves up to
its former position. This reduces the size
of the chest cavity and air is pushed out
of the lungs (Fig. 10.5). These
movements in our body can be felt

The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust,
pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the
nasal cavity. Then they irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we
sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-
free, clean air enters our body.

These openings are called spiracles
(Fig. 10.9). Insects have a network of air
tubes called tracheae for gas exchange.
Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles
into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the
body tissue, and reaches every cell of
the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from
the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and
moves out through spiracles. These air
tubes or tracheae are found only in
insects and not in any other group of
animals.

Earthworm: Recall from Chapter 9 of
Class VI that earthworms breathe

breathe through their skin, which is
moist and slippery.

dioxide. In the cells oxygen is used to
break down glucose into carbon dioxide
and water as in other organisms. In
plants each part can independently take
in oxygen from the air and give out
carbon dioxide. You have already learnt
in Chapter 1 that the leaves of the plants
have tiny pores called stomata for
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Paheli wants to know whether
roots, which are underground
also take in oxygen? If so, how?
10.6 BREATHING UNDER WATER
Can we survive in water? There are many
organisms which live in water. How do
they breathe under water?
You have studied in Class VI that
gills in fish help them to use oxygen
dissolved in water. Gills are projections
of the skin. You may wonder how gills
help in breathing. Gills are well supplied
with blood vessels (Fig. 10.10) for
exchange of gases.
Like all other living cells of the
plants, the root cells also need
oxygen to generate energy. Roots take
up air from the air spaces present
between the soil particles (Fig. 10.11).

What you have learnt
Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms. It releases energy
from the food.
The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide
and water. Energy is released in the process.
The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellular
respiration).
If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic
respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the
respiration is called anaerobic respiration.
During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is
insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.
Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an
organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon
dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different
organisms.
During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original
state as the air moves out during exhalation.
Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.
In animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and the
process of breathing are similar to those in humans.
In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In
fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.
In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores
called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of
glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings.

For us oxygen is essential, but for those organisms which do not use it,
oxygen is toxic. In fact, our white blood cells use oxygen to kill invading

SCIENCE
Transportation in Animals
and Plants
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 11.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in plants and animals.
11.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Heart

Artery
Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is a liquid, which has
cells of various kinds suspended in it.
Ella
Why is the colour of
blood red?
Fig. 11.1 Circulatory system
(Arteries are shown in red colour and vein in blue)
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.
Activity 11.1
The fluid part of the blood is called
plasma.
One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin bind
with oxygen and transports it to all the
parts of the body and ultimately to all
the cells. It will be difficult to provide
oxygen efficiently to all the cells of
the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 10. So, two types of
blood vessels are present in the arteries
and veins of the body. (Fig. 11.1)
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 11.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.

I am confused! I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygen-rich blood.
2010
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart.
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.

Refer to Fig. 11.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels. On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join up to
form veins which empty into the heart.
Heart
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 11.1). Hold your

makes your fist. Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four
chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 11.4). The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

SCIENCE
to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your
heart by listening through a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.

carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heartbeats. How many times did your
heartbeat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4-5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and
heartbeat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 11.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heartbeat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heartbeat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not posses any
circulatory system. The water in which
they live brings food and oxygen as it
enters their bodies. The water carries
away waste materials and carbon dioxide
as it moves out. Thus, these animals do
not need a circulatory fluid like the
blood.
Let us now learn about the remova
of waste other than carbon dioxide.
11.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells perform their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion forms the excretory system.
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578-1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called “circulator”. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harvey's idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.

seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat.
Does sweat serve any other function?
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot, which causes cooling.

The way in which waste chemicals are
removed from the body of the animal
depends on the availability of water.
Aquatic animals like fishes, excrete cell

which directly dissolves in water. Some
land animals like birds, lizards,
snakes excrete a semi-solid, white
coloured compound (uric acid). The

tube-like ureters. It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 11.6).
The kindeys, ureters, bladder and
urethra form the excretory system.
An adult human being normally
passes about 1-1.8 L of urine in 24
hours, and the urine consists of 95%
water, 2.5 % urea and 2.5% other waste
products.
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day. The sweat
Sometimes a person's kidneys may
stop working due to infection or

waste products start accumulating in
the blood. Such persons cannot

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 11.7 (b)].
Water

level of sugar solution. How did water
get inside the potato? For very short
distances water can move from one cell
to another. In the same way water
reaches xylem vessels of the root from
the soil [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants release
a lot of water by the process of
transpiration.
Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil. Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant. The
water evaporates through the stomata
present on the surface of the leaves by

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products to
different parts of the body for excretion.
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.
In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.
Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.
The human heart beats about 70-80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a
urinary bladder, and urethra.
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.

SCIENCE
Fish excrete waste substances which directly dissolve in water.
Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.
Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil.
Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the
vascular tissue called xylem.
The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the
plant is phloem.
A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata
during transpiration.
Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the
roots from the soil, to reach the stem and leaves.

Reproduction in Plants
and (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual
reproduction plants can give rise to new
plants without seeds, whereas in sexual
reproduction, new plants are obtained
from seeds.
Paheli thought that new
me plants always grow from seeds.
But, she has never seen the seeds
of sugarcane, potato and rose. She
wants to know how these plants
reproduce.
lo produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms. You have already
learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
12.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? The flowers perform the function
of reproduction in plants. Flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. A
flower may have either the male part or
the female part or both male and female
parts.
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring. These are
categorised into two types: (i) asexual,
D
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds or
spores.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Sind
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.

cutting every day and observe its
growth. Observe and record the number
of days taken for roots to come out and
new leaves to arise. Try the same activity

them in the soil. Water the pieces
regularly for a few days and observe
their progress. What do you find?
Bud in
the axil
Fig. 12.1 Stem-cutting of rose
You must have seen flower buds
developing into flowers. Apart from
flower buds, there are buds in the axil
(point of attachment of the leaf at the
node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 12.2). A bud consists of a
short stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are folded. The
vegetative buds can also give rise to new
plants.
Activity 12.2
Take a fresh potato. Observe the scars
on it with the help of a magnifying glass.
You may find bud(s) in them. These scars
are also called “eyes”. Cut a few pieces

If a leaf of this plant falls on a moist
soil, each bud can give rise to a new
plant.

multiply every few hours if sufficient
nutrients are made available to them.
Remember that yeast is a single-celled
organism. Let us see how they
reproduce?
Activity 12.3
(To be demonstrated by the teacher)
Take a piece of yeast cake or yeast
powder from a bakery or a chemist shop.
Take a pinch of yeast and place it in a
container with some water. Add a
spoonful of sugar and shake to dissolve
it. Keep it in the warm part of a room.
After an hour, put a drop of this liquid
on a glass slide and observe under a
microscope. What do you observe? You
may see the formation of new yeast cells
(Fig. 12.5).
Boojho wants to know if
there is any advantage of
vegetative propagation.

Fig. 12.5 Reproduction in yeast by budding
Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.
REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS
135
Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

Spore formation
In Chapter 1 you learnt that the fungi
on a bread piece grow from spores which
are present in the air. Repeat Activity
1.2. Observe the spores in the cotton-
Sporangium
like mesh on the bread. When spores
are released they keep floating in the
air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

SCIENCE
Activity 12.4
Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil.
The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

Boojho wants to know how the

water. Insects visit flowers and carry
away pollen on their bodies. Some of
the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)
and (b)].

gametes (to form a zygote) is called
fertilisation (Fig. 12.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
12.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango, apple and orange. Some fruits
are hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 12.12 (a) and (b)].
12.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.
Sometimes after a walk through a forest
or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

SCIENCE
Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

types of motions. You learnt that a

it could be circular or periodic. Can you

examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.

13.1 SLOW OR FAST
We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast.
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other.
Activity 13.1
Look at Fig. 13.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 13.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to
move. The distance covered by you after

direction on a road
it is easy to decide whose speed
is the highest. One who takes
shortest time to cover the
distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.
13.2 SPEED
You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
slower. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed
for one hour. In fact, it starts moving
slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of
a simple pendulum.
a constant speed or not during that
hour. The speed calculated here is
actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,
an Total distance covered
Total time taken
In everyday life we seldom find objects
| moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.
We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.
13.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME
If you did not have a clock, how would
you decide what time of the day it is?
Have you ever wondered how our elders
could tell the approximate time of the
day by just looking at shadows?
How do we measure time interval of
a month? A year?
Our ancestors noticed that many
events in nature repeat themselves after
definite intervals of time. For example,

clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that
by the clocks available earlier.
Units of time and speed
The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.

There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 -1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.
MOTION AND TIME
147
Different units of time are used
depending on the need. For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from ""two thousand and one"" to ""two
thousand and ten"". The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds. This rate may be
slightly higher for children.
Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 13.5).
13.4 MEASURING SPEED
Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.
Activity 13.3
Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 13.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?
GE
Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.
The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

Measure the distance between the point
at which the ball crosses the line and
the point where it comes to rest. You
can use a scale or a measuring
tape. Let different groups repeat the
activity. Record the measurements in
Table 13.3. In each case calculate the
speed of the ball.
You may now like to compare your
speed of walking or cycling with that of
your friends. You need to know the
distance of the school from your home
or from some other point. Each one of
you can then measure the time taken
to cover that distance and calculate your
speed. It may be interesting to know who

While going for a school picnic, Paheli
decided to note the reading on the
odometer of the bus after every
30 minutes till the end of the journey.
Later on she recorded her readings in

Take a sheet of graph paper. Draw
two lines perpendicular to each other
on it, as shown in Fig. 13.11. Mark the
horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as
the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical
line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point
of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is
known as the origin O. The two
quantities between which the graph is
drawn are shown along these two axes.
We show the positive values on the
x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive
values on the y-axis are shown along
OY. In this chapter we shall consider
only the positive values of quantities.
You can make the graph by following
the steps given below:
Draw two perpendicular lines to
represent the two axes and mark
them as OX and OY as in Fig. 13.11.
Decide the quantity to be shown
along the x-axis and that to be
shown along the y-axis. In this case

we show the time along the x-axis

Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm
Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, ... on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km ... on the y-axis (Fig. 13.12).
Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 13.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 13.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the
points corresponding to different
sets of values.

Generally, the choice of scales is not
as simple as in the example given above.
We may have to choose two different scales
to represent the desired quantities on the
x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to
understand this process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 13.5. The total distance covered
by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to
choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall
have to draw an axis of length 80 cm.
This is not possible on a sheet of paper.
On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1
cm would require an axis of length only
8 cm. This scale is quite convenient.
However, the graph may cover only a
small part of the graph paper. Some of
the points to be kept in mind while
choosing the most suitable scale for
drawing a graph are:
the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.
the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and
to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that we have a graph paper
of size 25 cm 25 cm. One of the scales
which meets the above conditions and
can accommodate the data of Table 13.5
could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm
Can you now draw the distance-time
graph for the motion of the bus? Is the
graph drawn by you similar to that
shown in Fig. 13.13?
Distance-time graphs provide a
variety of information about the motion
154
SCIENCE
when compared to the data presented
by a table. For example, Table 13.5 gives
information about the distance moved
by the bus only at some definite time
intervals. On the other hand, from the
distance-time graph we can find the
distance moved by the bus at any
instant of time. Suppose we want to
know how much distance the bus had
travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point
corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on
the x-axis. Suppose this point is A. Next
we draw a line perpendicular to the
x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at
point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 13.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the
y-axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How muc
is this distance in km? Can you now
help Paheli to find the distance moved
by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also
find the speed of the bus from its
distance-time graph?

What you have Learnt
The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.
Speed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the
other.
The speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time taken
to cover that distance. Its basic unit is metre per second (m/s).
Periodic events are used for the measurement of time. Periodic motion of
a pendulum has been used to make clocks and watches.
Motion of objects can be presented in pictorial form by their
distance-time graphs.
The distance-time graph for the motion of an object moving with a constant
speed is a straight line.

atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle
is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of

be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.
Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 13.16. Mark the position of the tip
of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day
as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow
every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked
by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 13.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use
this sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember that

An electric bulb is used for light but it also gives heat. This is not desirable. This
results in the wastage of electricity. This wastage can be reduced by using
fluorescent tube lights in place of the bulbs. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)
also reduce wastage and can be fixed in the ordinary bulb holders.

Fuses of different kinds are used
for different purposes. Fig. 14.14 shows
fuses used in our houses. Fuses
shown in Fig. 14.15 are generally used
in electrical appliances.

the nichrome wire, tie a thin strand of
steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly
used for cleaning utensils and is
available in grocery shops.) If there are
any fans in the room, switch them off.
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime. Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully. Note what happens. Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break?
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
| touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
| off due to wear and tear. This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket. This may cause overload in
| the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?
166
SCIENCE
These days Miniature
circuit breakers (MCBs)
are increasingly being
used in place of fuses.
These are switches which
automatically turn off
when current in a circuit
exceeds the safe limit. You
turn them on and the
circuit is once again
complete. Look for ISI
mark on MCBs also.

Always, use proper fuses which have
been specified for particular
applications, carrying ISI mark. Never
use just any wire or strip of metal in

What do you observe? Does the compass
needle deflect? Move the switch back to
the ‘OFF' position. Does the compass

north-south direction. When we bring
a magnet close to it, the needle gets
deflected. We have also seen that

compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.
14.4 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 14.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6-10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 14.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.
14.5 ELECTRIC BELL
We are quite familiar with an electric bell.
It has an electromagnet in it. Let us see
how it works.

electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire
wound on an iron piece. The coil acts

SCIENCE
as an electromagnet. An iron strip with
a hammer at one end is kept close to
the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,
pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.

It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols. Using these,
an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram.
When an electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets heated. It is
the heating effect of current. This effect has many applications.
Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed through them. These materials are
used for making electric fuses which prevent fires and damage to electric
appliances.
When an electric current flows through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
A current carrying coil of an insulated wire wrapped around a piece of
iron is called an electromagnet.

The candle itself is the object.
Now move the candle to different
positions in front of the mirror. Observe
the image in each case.

Boojho noted in his notebook: Is
it not surprising that my image is

Was the image upright in each case?
Did the flame appear on top of the candle
as in the object? Such an image is called
erect. An image formed by a plane
mirror is erect and of the same size as
the object.
Now place a vertical screen behind
the mirror. Try to obtain the image of

spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind”, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image.
Activity 15.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it. Do you see your image
in it (Fig. 15.10)? Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?
Fig. 15.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon
The curved shining surface of a
spoon acts as a mirror. The most
common example of a curved mirror is
a spherical mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 15.12).

Why are concave and convex mirrors
called spherical mirrors?
Take a rubber ball and cut a
portion of it with a knife or a hack-
saw blade (Fig. 15.13 (a)]. (Be careful.
Ask an elder person to help you in
cutting the ball). The inner surface
of the cut ball is called concave and
the outer surface is called convex
(Fig. 15.13 (b)).

The inner surface of a spoon acts like
a concave mirror, while its outer surface
acts like a convex mirror.
We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.
Activity 15.6
Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 15.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 15.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror.
Activity 15.7
CAUTION
You will conduct Activity 15.6 in the
sunlight. Be careful, never look
directly towards the sun or its image
as it may damage your eyes. You may
look at the image of the sun when it
is thrown on a screen or a wall.
Fix a concave mirror on a stand (any
arrangement to keep the mirror steady
would do) and place it on a table

the screen. For this, move the screen till
a sharp image of the flame is obtained
Make sure that, the screen does not
obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror. Is this image real or
virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame?
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 15.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 15.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists

size than the object?
Can you now recognise the mirrors
used as side mirrors in scooters? These
are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can
form images of objects spread over a large
area. So, these help the drivers to see
the traffic behind them (Fig. 15.20).
15.5 IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES
You might have seen a magnifying glass.
It is used to read very small print
(Fig. 15.21). You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a
cockroach or an earthworm. The
magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.
Lenses are widely used in spectacles,
telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.
Get some lenses. Touch and feel
them. Can you find some difference just
by touching? Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges
are convex lenses (Fig. 15.22 (a)]. Those

CAUTION
It is dangerous to look through a lens
at the sun or a bright light. You should
also be careful not to focus sunlight
with a convex lens on any part of your
body.

Activity 15.9
Take a convex lens or magnifying glass.
Put it in the path of sunrays. Place a
sheet of paper as shown (Fig. 15.23).
Adjust the distance between the lens and
the paper till you get a bright spot on
the paper. Hold the lens and the paper
in this position for a few minutes. Does
the paper begin to burn?
Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens. Do you see a bright spot
A convex lens converges (bends
inward) the light generally falling on it
[Fig. 15.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a
converging lens. On the other hand, a
concave lens diverges (bends outward)
the light and is called a diverging lens
[Fig. 15.24 (b)].

you not getting a bright spot this time?
We have seen in the case of mirrors
that for different positions of the object
the nature and size of the image change.
Is it true for lenses also?
Let us find out.
Activity 15.10
Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand
as you did with the concave mirror. Place
it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a
distance of about 50 cm from the lens
[Fig. 15.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image
of the candle on a paper screen placed
on the other side of the lens. You may
have to move the screen towards or away
from the lens to get a sharp image of
the flame. What kind of image did you
get? Is it real or virtual?
Now vary the distance of the candle
from the lens [Fig. 15.25 (b)]. Try to
obtain the image of the candle flame
every time on the paper screen by
moving it. Record your observations as
you did in Activity 15.7 for the concave
mirror.
It means that we can see the

Did you get in any position of the
object an image which was erect and
magnified (Fig. 15.26). Could this image
be obtained on a screen? Is the image
real or virtual? This is how a convex lens
is used as a magnifying glass.
In a similar fashion study the images
formed by a concave lens. You will find
that the image formed by a concave lens
is always virtual, erect and smaller in
size than the object (Fig. 15.27).

How many colours are present in a
rainbow? When observed carefully, there
are seven colours in a rainbow, though
it may not be easy to distinguish all of
them. These are — red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo and violet.
You might have seen that when you
blow soap bubbles, they appear

What you have learnt
Light travels along straight lines.
Any polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.
An image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.
An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.
The image formed by a plane mirror is erect. It is virtual and is of the
same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.
In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on the
right side in the image, and right side of the object appears to be on the
left side in the image.
A concave mirror can form a real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified.
Image formed by a convex mirror is erect, virtual and smaller in size
than the object.
A convex lens can forms real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is called
a magnifying glass.
A concave lens always forms erect, virtual and smaller image than the
object.
White light is composed of seven colours.

The object and the image will sit opposite to each other. The object will
make movements, such as raising a hand, touching an ear, etc. The
image will have to make the correct movement following the movement
of the object. The rest of the group will watch the movements of the
image. If the image fails to make the correct movement, she/he will be
retired. Another child will take her/his place and the game will
continue. A scoring scheme can be introduced. The group that scores
the maximum will be declared the winner.

The mirrors can be used as weapons. Archimedes, a Greek scientist, is said
to have done just that more than two thousand years ago. When the
Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 15.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an
example of triumph of ideas over military might.

teachers must very often be advising you
not to waste water. No wonder we
celebrate water day every year to attract
the attention of everybody towards the
importance of conserving water.
The amount of water recommended
by the United Nations for drinking,
washing, cooking and maintaining proper
hygiene is a minimum of 50 litres per
person per day. This amount is about
two and a half buckets of water per
person per day. Is your family getting at
least this much of water? If yes, you
should consider yourself fortunate
because millions of people in our
country do not get enough water. What
about your friends and their families?
Share your experience with them.
In some places there is an acute
shortage of water. Taps running dry,
long queues for water (Fig. 16.2), fights,
marches and protests for demand of
water have become a common sight,
especially during summers. Some of the

and pictures related to water shortage.
Paste them in your scrapbook and share

Water shortage has become a matter
of concern throughout the world. It is
estimated that in a few years from now
more than one third of the people in
the world could face water scarcity.
Before we discuss why water is
getting scarce we must know how much
water is available for use on our planet.
16.1 HOW MUCH WATER IS AVAILABLE
Look at the picture of the earth taken
from space. Why does it appear blue?
Surely, you can guess!
You are aware that about 71% of
the earth's surface is covered with
water. Almost all the water on the
earth is contained in the seas and
oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as
groundwater and in the atmosphere.
However, most of this water is not fit for
human consumption. The water that is
fit for use is freshwater. Perform the

finding worry you? Discuss this in your
class.
16.2 FORMS OF WATER
Are you afraid that continuous use will
some day exhaust all the water available
for use? You know that water on the
earth has been maintained for millions
of years by various processes which
make the water cycle. You have studied
the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your
own words what you know about the
water cycle.
You know that when water circulates
through the water cycle it can be found
in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid
and gas—at any given time somewhere
on the earth. The solid form, snow and
ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of
the earth, snow-covered mountains and
glaciers. Liquid water is present in
oceans, lakes, rivers, and even
underground. The gaseous form is the
water vapour present in the air around
us. The continuous cycling of water
among its three forms keeps the total
amount of water on the earth constant
even when the whole world is using it.
Does it give you any relief?
Can you recall the processes involved
in water cycle? The following activity will
help you.

SCIENCE
bodies. The water is drawn from
nearby lakes, rivers, ponds or
wells. The water is supplied
through a network of pipes.
Many villages do not have such
a water supply system. There
people fetch water directly from
the sources. Often women and
children have to walk several
kilometres to fetch water
(Fig. 16.6). The children suffer
a lot. They cannot attend
school regularly since they
spend hours in fetching water.
Women have to
perform a number of
household chores. If they have
also to spend time to fetch water
it adds to their burden.
A large number of people draw water
from wells, tube wells or hand pumps.
From where do these sources get water?
16.3 GROUNDWATER AS AN IMPORTANT
SOURCE OF WATER
If we dig a hole in the ground near a
water body we may find that the soil is
moist. The moisture in the soil indicates
the presence of water underground. If
we dig deeper and deeper, we would
reach a level where all the space between
particles of soil and gaps between rocks
are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The
upper limit of this layer is called the
water table. The water table varies from
Fig. 16.6 Women fetching water
place to place, and it may even change
at a given place. The water table may be
at a depth of less than a metre or may
be several metres below the ground. The
water found below the water table is
called groundwater. What is the source
of this groundwater?
The rainwater and water from other
sources such as rivers and ponds seeps
through the soil and fills the empty
spaces and cracks deep below the
ground. The process of seeping of water
into the ground is called infiltration.
The groundwater thus gets recharged
by this process. At places the
groundwater is stored between layers of
hard rock below the water table. This is
known as an aquifer. Water in the
aquifers can be usually pumped out with
the help of tube wells or handpumps.
Have you ever been to a site where
construction work is going on? From

where do the workers get water for
construction? May be you have seen
boring being done at such sites to reach
the water table. Enquire from the people
working there how deep they have to dig.
Can we keep on drawing water from
under the ground? How will it affect the
water table?
16.4 DEPLETION OF WATER TABLE
Water drawn from under the ground gets
replenished by seepage of rainwater. The
water table does not get affected as long
as we draw as much water as is
replenished by natural processes.
However, water table may go down if the
water is not sufficiently replenished.
This may happen due to many reasons.
Increase in population, industrial and
agricultural activities are some common
factors affecting water table. Scanty
rainfall is another factor that may
deplete the water table. Yet another
factor affecting water table could be
deforestation and decrease in the
effective area for seepage of water.
Increasing population
Increasing population creates demand
for construction of houses, shops,
offices, roads and pavements. This
decreases the open areas like parks, and
playgrounds. This, in turn, decreases the
seepage of rainwater into the ground.
What could be the consequence? Recall
that a pukka floor does not allow water
to seep in easily, while in a grass lawn
water seeps through in no time.
198
SCIENCE
Moreover a huge amount of water is
required for construction work. Often
groundwater is used for this purpose.
So, on the one hand we are
consuming more groundwater, and on
the other we are allowing lesser water
to seep into the ground. This results in
depletion of water table. In fact, the
water table in some parts of many cities
has gone down to alarmingly low levels.
Increasing industries
Water is used by all the industries.
Almost everything that we use needs
water somewhere in its production
process. The number of industries is
increasing continuously. Water used by
most of the industries is drawn from the
ground.
day by day. This results in depletion of
water table.
16.5 DISTRIBUTION OF WATER
The distribution of water over the globe
is quite uneven due to a number of
factors.
Some places have good amount of
rain and are water-rich. On the other
hand, there are deserts which have
scanty rainfall.
India is a vast country and the
rainfall is not the same everywhere.
Some regions have excessive rains while
some others have very little rainfall.
Excessive rains cause floods, whereas
the absence of rains results in droughts.
Therefore, some regions in our country
may have floods while others may suffer
from droughts at the same time.
Activity 16.5
Activity 16.4
Name some industries familiar to you.
Make a list of the products obtained
from these and used in our daily life.
Discuss with your teacher and parents
how the growing industrial activity is
responsible for the depletion of water
table.
Agricultural activities
A majority of farmers in India depend
upon rains for irrigating their crops.
Irrigation systems such as canals are
there only in a few places. Even these
systems may suffer from lack of water
due to erratic rainfall. Therefore, farmers
have to use groundwater for irrigation.
Population pressure on agriculture
forces increasing use of groundwater
Given here is the rainfall map of India
(Fig. 16.8). It gives the average annual
rainfall in different regions of our country.
Locate on the map the place you live
in.
Are you blessed with sufficient
rainfall?
Is there sufficient water available in
your area throughout the year?
It may be possible that we are living
in an area where there is sufficient
rainfall yet there is shortage of water. Can
we attribute this to mismanagement of
water resources?

When the civic authorities supply water
through pipes not all of it may reach
the destination. You might have seen
water supply pipes leaking and a lot of
water gushing out of the pipes. It is
the responsibility of the civic
authorities to prevent such wastage of
precious water.
Mismanagement or wastage may
take place at the level of individuals also.
All of us, knowingly or unknowingly,
waste water while brushing teeth,
shaving, bathing, washing and during
many other activities. Leaking taps is
another source of huge water wastage.
We waste water as though we do not need
water the next time!
We have seen that most of the water
that we get as rainfall just flows away.
This is a waste of precious natural
resource. The rainwater can be used to
recharge the groundwater. This is
referred to as water harvesting or
rainwater harvesting, about which you
have learnt in Class VI.
Find out if the buildings in your
neighbourhood have water harvesting
systems installed.
We have at many places in India an
age old practice of water storage and
water recharge like the bawris. Bawri
was the traditional way of collecting
water. With time the bawris fell into
disuse and garbage started piling in these
reservoirs. However, because of the acute
water shortage, people in these areas
have had to rethink. The bawris are being
revived. Today the situation is that inspite
of scanty rains these places are
managing their water needs well.
A farmer using water in the field can
also use water economically. Maybe
you have heard of drip irrigation
(Fig. 16.9). Drip irrigation is a technique
of watering plants by making use of
narrow tubings which deliver water
directly at the base of the plant.
A case study
Bhujpur in the Kutch area of Gujarat has a very erratic rainfall. The only source
of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water
throughout the year. Over the years, demand for water has grown. The withdrawal
of groundwater has far exceeded recharge. As a result the water table has gone
down alarmingly.
In 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to
harvest rainwater. Eighteen check-dams were built on the Rukmavati river and
its many tributaries. The water so collected increased percolation through the
soil and recharged the aquifers.
According to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into
the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation.

16.7 WHAT ROLE YOU CAN PLAY
Have you ever shown concern if you saw
a tap leaking in your house, school or
any other place? Leaking taps waste a
lot of water. You must make efforts to
stop this leakage.
There are a number of ways you can
adopt to minimise the wastage of water.
Let us begin. We have given a few
examples. Add on!
16.8 EFFECT OF WATER SCARCITY ON
PLANTS
You must have seen potted plants
wilting and ultimately drying up if they
did not get water even for a few days.
You have already learnt in Chapter 1
that plants need water to get nutrients
from the soil to prepare their food. Just
imagine the consequences if water is not
available to plants!
The green character of the planet
shall be lost. This may mean the end
of all life, for a world without plants
shall mean no food, no oxygen, not
enough rain, and innumerable other
problems.
A successful initiative
Rajasthan is a hot and dry place. The challenge of natural scarcity of water was
met by a successful experiment. A band of social workers has transformed a dry
area in the Alwar district into a green place. They have revived five dried-up
rivers — Arveri, Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahazwali by constructing water-
harvesting structures.

What you have learnt
Water is essential for all living beings. There can be no life without it.
Water exists in three forms: solid, liquid and vapour.
Though water is maintained by the water cycle, yet there is an acute
scarcity of water in many parts of the globe.
There is an uneven distribution of water. Much of it has resulted from
human activities.
Rapid growth of industries, increasing population, growing irrigation
requirements and mismanagement are some of the causes for water
shortage.
We need to be worried about the wastage during the supply of water
through pipes, the leaking taps in buildings and other places.
Unnecessary use of water and overdrawing from groundwater should be
avoided. Recharge of water to the ground should be increased.
The need of the hour is that every individual uses water economically.
Plants wilt and ultimately dry-up if they are not watered for a few days.

ne evening Boojho entered the
park with an elderly person. He
introduced him to his friends.
Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in
the university. The children started
playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a
bench in the corner. He was tired as he
had participated in the golden jubilee
celebrations of the town. After a while,
the children also came and sat around
him. They wanted to know about the
celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that
after the cultural programme, the
senior people discussed the town's
unemployment problem. A plan was
proposed to put up a factory by clearing
an area of the forest just outside the
town. This would give the increasing
population of the town a chance to get
jobs. The children were very surprised
when Prof Ahmad told them that many
people had objected to this idea.
“This is because the forests serve as
green lungs and water purifying systems
in nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The
children were confused. Prof Ahmad
realised that the children had not visited
a forest. The children also wanted to
know more about the forest, so they
decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.
17.1 VISIT TO A FOREST
One Sunday morning, the children
packed a few things like a knife, a hand
lens, a stick, a notebook and walked
together through a forest trail near a
village. On their way, they met Tibu, a
young boy of their age group, of nearby
village, who was taking cattle for grazing
along with his aunt. He was very agile,
running here and there to keep the herd
together. When he saw the children,
Tibu also started walking along with
them, while his aunt went on a different
path. As soon as they entered the forest
Tibu raised his hand and signalled them
to keep quiet because noise could
disturb the animals living in the forest.
Tibu then took them to a place at a
height to show them the broad view of
the forest. Children were surprised
because they could not see any land
(Fig. 17.1). The different treetops had
formed green cover over the land. However,
the cover was not uniformly green. The

M
environment was peaceful and a cool
breeze was blowing. This made children
quite fresh and happy.
While coming down, they got excited
on hearing a sudden sound of birds and
some noise from the top branches of the
trees. Tibu told them to relax since it
was a normal phenomenon here.
Because of the children's presence, some
monkeys had climbed higher up on the
trees where they disturbed the birds.
Animals often give this type of warning
call to alert other animals. Tibu also told
that many other animals like boar,
bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live
in the deeper areas of the forest
(Fig. 17.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned
children that they should not go deep
into the forest.
Boojho and Paheli remembered that
they have studied about forests as

The land where the children were
walking was uneven and covered with
many trees. Tibu helped them to identify
sal, teak, semal, sheesham, neem,
palash, fig, khair, amla, bamboo,
kachnar (Fig. 17.4). Prof Ahmad pointed
out that there are several other trees,
shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.
The trees were also covered with different
types of creepers and climbers. The sun
was barely visible through the leaves of
the trees, making it quite dark inside
the forest.
Activity 17.1
Observe the various things in your home
and make a list of those which are made
from material which may have been
obtained from the forest.
You might have many wooden items
on your list like plywood, fuel wood,
boxes, paper, matchsticks, and
furniture. Do you know that gum, oils,
spices, fodder for animals and medicinal
plants are also some of the products
which we get from the forest (Fig. 17.5).

Sheila wondered who would have
planted these trees. Prof Ahmad replied
that in nature trees produce enough
seeds. The forest floor provides
favourable conditions for them to
germinate and develop into seedlings

Prof Ahmad asked children to look
up and observe how the branches of the
tall trees look like a roof over the other
plants in the forest. He told them that
this is called a canopy (Fig. 17.7).
Activity 17.2
Visit a forest or a park in your
neighbourhood. Observe the trees and
try to identify them. You can take the
help of some elders or books on trees.
List the characteristics of the trees that
you observe, such as the height, shape
of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also
draw the crowns of some trees.
Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees
had crowns of different types and sizes.
These had created different horizontal
layers in the forest. These are known as
understoreys (Fig. 17.7). Giant and tall
trees constituted the top layer followed
by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs
formed the lowest layer.
“Would we see similar kind of trees
in every forest?” — asked Boojho.
Prof Ahmad said, “No, due to different
climatic conditions there are variations
in the types of trees and other plants.
The types of animals also differ from
forest to forest.”

Children picked up various seeds

over the dead leaf layer on the forest floor
was like walking over a spongy carpet!
Is the decaying matter always warm?
Prof Ahmad suggested that the children
could perform an activity to get an
answer to this question.

Paheli asked, “There are so many
trees here. Also, there are many forest
like this. What difference will it make if
we cut some trees for a factory?”
Prof Ahmad said, “You have read
about autotrophs, heterotrophs and
saprotrophs. You have learnt how green
plants produce food. All animals,
whether herbivores or carnivores,
depend ultimately on plants for food.
Organisms which feed on plants often
get eaten by other organisms, and so
on. For example, grass is eaten by
insects, which in turn, is taken by the
frog. The frog is consumed by snakes.
This is said to form a food chain:
Grass → insects → frog → snake → eagle.
Many food chains can be found in the
forest. All food chains are linked. If any
one food chain is disturbed, it affects
other food chains. Every part of the
forest is dependent on the other parts.
If we remove one component, say trees,
all other components would be affected.”

plants release oxygen through the
process of photosynthesis. The plants
help to provide oxygen for animal
respiration. They also maintain the
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide

why forests are called lungs.

decaying leaves. They also saw an army
of tiny insects, millipedes, ants and
beetle on them. They were wondering
how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad
explained that apart from these animals
which are easily seen, there are several
organisms and micro-organisms that
live in the soil. Paheli wondered what
mushroom and other micro-organisms
eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed
upon the dead plant and animal tissues
and convert them into a dark coloured
substance called humus.
You have learnt about humus in
Chapter 9. In which layer of the soil
would you find humus? What is its
importance to the soil?
The micro-organisms which convert
the dead plants and animals to humus
are known as decomposers. These
micro-organisms play an important role
in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some
dead leaves and discovered under them
a layer of humus on forest floor. The
presence of humus ensures that the
nutrients of the dead plants and
animals are released into the soil. From
there, these nutrients are again absorbed
by the roots of the living plants. “What
happens if an animal dies in the forest?”
Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead
animals become food for vultures, crows,
jackals and insects.” In this way, the
nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes
waste in a forest (Fig. 17.9).
Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he
had not explained why forests are called
green lungs. Prof Ahmad explained that

What you have learnt
We get various products from the forests surrounding us.
Forest is a system comprising various plants, animals and
micro-organisms.
In a forest, trees form the uppermost layer, followed by shrubs.
The herbs form the lowest layer of vegetation.
Different layers of vegetation provide food and shelter for animals,
birds and insects.
The various components of the forest are interdependent on one
another.
The forest keeps on growing and changing, and can regenerate.
In the forest, there is interaction between soil, water, air and
living organisms.
Forests protect the soil from erosion.
Soil helps forests to grow and regenerate.
Forests are the lifeline for the forest-dwelling communities.
Forests influence climate, water cycle and air quality.

Make a line diagram of the sewage
route.
Walk down the street or survey the
campus to find the number of
manholes.
Follow an open drain and find out
where it ends and which living

In case you do not have a sewerage
system in your locality, find out how
sewage is being disposed off.
Treatment of polluted water
Perform the following activity. It will help
you understand the processes that take
place at the wastewater treatment plant.
Activity 18.4
Divide yourself into groups to perform
the activity. Record observations at each
stage:
• Fill a large glass jar 3/4 full of water.
Add some dirty organic matter such
as grass pieces or orange peels, a
small amount of detergent, and a few
drops of an ink or any colour.
• Cap the jar, shake it well and let the
mixture stand in the sun for two
days.
After two days, shake the mixture
and pour a small sample into test
tube. Label this test tube “Before
treatment; Sample 1”. How does it
smell?
• Use an aerator from an aquarium to
bubble air through the sample in the
glass jar. Allow several hours for
aeration; leave the aerator attached
overnight. If you do not have an
aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or
a mixer. You may have to stir it
several times.
The next day when aeration is
complete, pour another sample into
a second test tube. Label it as “After
aeration; Sample 2”.
Fold a piece of filter paper to form a
cone. Wet the paper with tap water
and then insert the cone in a funnel.
Mount the funnel on a support
(as you have learnt in Class VI).
Place layers of sand, fine gravel and
finally medium gravel in the funnel
(Fig. 18.2). (An actual filtration plant
does not use filter paper, but the sand
filter is several metres deep).
Pour the remaining aerated liquid
through the filter into the beakers.
Do not allow the liquid to spill over
the filter. If the filtered liquid is not
clear, filter it a few times till you get
clear water.
· Pour a sample of the filtered water
into a third test tube labelled
“Filtered; Sample 3”.
. Pour another sample of the filtered
water into a fourth test tube. Add a
small piece of a chlorine tablet. Mix
well until the water is clear. Label the
test tube “Chlorinated; Sample 4"".

2. Water then goes to a grit and sand
removal tank. The speed of the
incoming wastewater is decreased to
allow sand, grit and pebbles to settle
down (Fig. 18.4).
. Observe carefully the samples in all
the test tubes. Do not taste! Just
smell them!
Now answer the following questions:
(a) What changes did you observe in the
appearance of the liquid after
aeration?
(b) Did aeration change the odour?
(c) What was removed by the sand filter?
(d) Did chlorine remove the colour?
(e) Did chlorine have an odour? Was it
worse than that of the wastewater?
18.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
(WWTP)
Treatment of wastewater involves
physical, chemical, and biological
processes, which remove physical,
chemical and biological matter that
contaminates the wastewater.
1. Wastewater is passed through bar
screens. Large objects like rags,
sticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins
are removed (Fig. 18.3).
Fig. 18.4 Grit and sand removal tank
3. The water is then allowed to settle in
a large tank which is sloped towards
the middle. Solids like faeces settle
at the bottom and are removed with
a scraper. This is the sludge. A
skimmer removes the floatable solids
like oil and grease. Water so cleared
is called clarified water (Fig. 18.5).
WASTEWATER STORY
223
The activated sludge is about 97%
water. The water is removed by sand
drying beds or machines. Dried sludge
is used as manure, returning organic
matter and nutrients to the soil.
The treated water has a very low level
of organic material and suspended
matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river
or into the ground. Nature cleans it up
further. Sometimes it may be necessary
to disinfect water with chemicals like
chlorine and ozone before releasing it
into the distribution system.
Become an active citizen
Waste generation is a natural part of
human activity. But we can limit the
type of waste and quantity of waste
produced. Often we have been repelled
by offensive smell. The sight of open
drains is disgusting. The situation
Fig. 18.5 Water clarifer
The sludge is transferred to a
separate tank where it is decomposed
by the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas
produced in the process can be used as
fuel or can be used to produce electricity.
4. Air is pumped into the clarified water
to help aerobic bacteria to grow.
Bacteria consume human waste,
food waste, soaps and other
unwanted matter still remaining in
clarified water (Fig. 18.6).
After several hours, the suspended
microbes settle at the bottom of the tank
as activated sludge. The water is then
removed from the top.
The water in a river is cleaned
naturally by processes that are
similar to those adopted in a
wastewater treatment plant.
Did you know?
It has been suggested that we should
plant eucalyptus trees all along
sewage ponds. These trees absorb all
surplus wastewater rapidly and
release pure water vapour into the
atmosphere.

PRACTICES
One of the ways to minimise or eliminate
waste and pollutants at their source is
to see what you are releasing down the
drain.
• Cooking oil and fats should not be
thrown down the drain. They can
harden and block the pipes. In an
open drain the fats clog the soil pores

water. Throw oil and fats in the

A design of a toilet in which humans excreta is treated by earthworms has been

without sewerage facilities. Where do
they relieve themselves?
A very large fraction of our people
defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds,
on railway tracks, near fields and many
a time directly in water. Untreated
human excreta is a health hazard. It
may cause water pollution and soil
pollution. Both the surface water and
groundwater get polluted. Groundwater
is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
springs and many rivers as you learnt
in Chapter 16. Thus, it becomes the
most common route for water borne
diseases. They include cholera, typhoid,
polio, meningitis, hepatitis and
dysentery.
18.8 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR
SEWAGE DISPOSAL
To improve sanitation, low cost onsite
sewage disposal systems are being
encouraged. Examples are septic tanks,
chemical toilets, composting pits. Septic
tanks are suitable for places where there
is no sewerage system, for hospitals,
isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5
houses.
Some organisations offer hygienic
on-site human waste disposal
technology. These toilets do not require
scavenging. Excreta from the toilet seat
flow through covered drains into a
biogas plant. The biogas produced is
used as a source of energy.
18.9 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES
In our country fairs are organised
periodically. A large number of people
participate in them. In the same way
railway stations, bus depots, airports,
hospitals are very busy places.
Thousands of people visit them daily.
Large amount of waste is generated
here. It must be disposed of properly
otherwise epidemics could break out.
The government has laid down
certain standards of sanitation but,
unfortunately, they are not strictly
enforced.
However, all of us can contribute in
maintaining sanitation at public places.
We should not scatter litter anywhere.
If there is no dustbin in sight, we should
carry the litter home and throw it in the
dustbin.

Conclusion
We all have a role to play in keeping our
environment clean and healthy. You

maintaining the water sources in a
healthy state. Adopting good sanitation
practices should be our way of life. As

What you have learnt
Used water is wastewater. Wastewater could be reused.
Wastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in
other human activities. This is called sewage.
Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution.
Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.
Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature
can take care of it.
Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are
not available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted.
By-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas.
Open drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organisms
which cause diseases.
We should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal of
excreta by low cost methods.

What you have learnt
The day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to
the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-speed, etc., is called the
weather at that place.
The weather is generally not the same on any two days and week after
week.
The maximum temperature of the day occurs generally in the afternoon
while the minimum temperature occurs in the early morning.
The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year.
All the changes in the weather are driven by the sun.
The average weather pattern taken over a long time, say 25 years, is
called the climate of the place.
The tropical and the polar regions are the two regions of the earth,
which have severe climatic conditions.
Animals are adapted to the conditions in which they live.
The polar regions are very cold throughout the year. The sun does not
set for six months in a year and in the other six months it does not rise.
Animals in the polar region are adapted to the extremely cold climate by
having some special characteristics such as white fur, strong sense of
smell, a layer of fat under the skin, wide and large paws for swimming
and walking, etc.
Migration is another means to escape the harsh, cold conditions.
Because of the hospitable climatic conditions huge populations of plants
and animals are found in the tropical rainforests.
Animals in the tropical rainforests are adapted such that they eat
different kinds of food to overcome the competition for food and shelter.
Some adaptations of animals living in the tropical rainforests include
living on the trees, development of strong tails, long and large beaks,
bright colours, sharp patterns, loud voice, diet of fruits, sensitive hearing,
sharp eyesight, thick skin, ability to camouflage in order to protect
themselves from predators, etc.

Winds, Storms and Cyclones
rissa was hit by a cyclone with
wind speed of 200 km/h on
18 October 1999. The cyclone
smashed 45,000 houses making
7,00,000 people homeless. On
29 October the same year, a second
cyclone with wind speed of 260 km/h
hit Orissa again. It was accompanied by
water waves about 9 m high. Thousands
of people lost their lives. Property worth
crores of rupees was destroyed. The
cyclone affected agriculture, transport,
communication, and electricity supply.
But, what are cyclones? How are
they formed? Why are they so
destructive? In this chapter we shall
seek answers to some of these questions.
We begin with some activities
involving air. These activities will clarify
some basic features concerning a
cyclone. Before we begin, remember that
the moving air is called the wind.
8.1 AIR EXERTS PRESSURE
Activity 8.1
Whenever an activity involves heating,
be very careful. It is advised that such
activities are performed in the
presence of an elderly person from
your family. Or, carry out these
activities in the presence of your
teacher.
You need to boil water in the following
activity.
Take a tin can with a lid. Fill it
approximately half with water. Heat the
can on a candle flame till the water boils.
Let the water boil for a few minutes. Blow
out the candle. Immediately put the lid
tightly on the can. Be careful in handling
the hot can. Put the can carefully in a
shallow metallic vessel or a washbasin.
Pour fresh water over the can.
What happens to the shape of the can?

is blowing. You can list some more
experiences which show that the air has
pressure.
Let us now try to explain why the
can (or the bottle) gets distorted. As
water is poured over the can, some
steam in the can condenses into water,
reducing the amount of air inside. The
pressure of air inside the can decreases
than the pressure exerted by the air
from outside the can. As a result the
can gets compressed.
This activity again confirms that air
exerts pressure.
8.2 HIGH SPEED WINDS ARE
ACCOMPANIED BY REDUCED AIR
PRESSURE
Activity 8.2
Fig. 8.2 Can with hot water being cooled
Can you guess why the shape of the
can gets distorted?
If you cannot get a tin can, take a
soft plastic bottle. Fill it with hot water.
Empty the bottle and immediately cap
it tightly. Place the bottle under running
water.
Recall now some of your experiences.
When you fly a kite, does the wind
coming from your back help?
If you are in a boat, is it easier to
row it if there is wind coming from
behind you?
Do you find it difficult to ride a bicycle
against the direction of the wind.
You know that we have to fill air into
the bicycle tube to keep it tight. Also,
you know that a bicycle tube overfilled
with air may burst. What is the air doing
inside the tube?
Discuss with your friends how the
air in the bicycle tube keeps it in shape.
All these experiences show that the
air exerts pressure. It is due to this
pressure that the leaves of trees,
banners, or flags flutter when the wind

balloons to see what happens.
Activity 8.4
Can you blow and lift?
Hold a strip of paper, 20 cm long and
3 cm wide, between your thumb and
forefinger as shown in the Fig. 8.5. Now
blow over the paper.
What do you think will happen to
the paper?
Let us try to understand the
observations in Activities 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.
Were the observations along the lines
you thought? Do you get the feeling
that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure?
When we blow into the mouth of the
bottle, the air near the mouth has higher
speed. This decreases the pressure
there. The air pressure inside the bottle
is higher than near the mouth. The air
inside the bottle pushes the ball out.

in the figure. Observe what happens.
Why is the balance of the bags

Does this activity indicate that warm
air rises up? As the warm air rises up,
it pushes the bag above the candle. Does
the disturbance of the balance suggest
that the warm air is lighter than the cold
air?
Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.
8.4 WIND CURRENTS ARE GENERATED
DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON
THE EARTH
These situations are:
(a) Uneven heating between
the equator and the poles
You might have learnt in Geography that
regions close to the equator get
maximum heat from the Sun. The air
in these regions gets warm. The warm
air rises, and the cooler air from the

regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.
(b) Uneven heating of land
and water
You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).
The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam', which means
‘season'.
In winter, the direction of the wind
flow gets reversed; it flows from the land
to the ocean (Fig. 8.10).

winds do for us.

water cycle.
The monsoon winds carry water

Clouds bring rain and give us

depend mainly on rains for their
harvests. There are many folk songs
associated with clouds and rain. Sing
and enjoy with your friends, if you know
such a song. Here is one for you.
The winds would have flown in the
north-south direction from north to
south, or from south to north. A change
in direction is however, caused by the
rotation of the earth.

SCIENCE
8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.

that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.
2. You can make your own anemometer.
Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

• Do you see layers of particles of

Are there some dead rotting leaves

The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different
layers of the soil is called the soil profile.

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.

is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.

When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time

spill over or run down on the outside of
the pipe while pouring. Calculate the
rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)

For example, suppose that for a
certain sample, it took 20 minutes for
200 mL to percolate. So,

9.5 MOISTURE IN SOIL
Have you ever passed through a
farmland during a hot summer day?
Perhaps you noticed that the air above
the land is shimmering. Why is it so?
Try out this activity and find the answer.
Activity 9.5
Take a boiling tube. Put two spoonfulls
of a soil sample in it. Heat it on a flame
(Fig. 9.6) and observe it. Let us find out
what happens upon heating.
Do you see water drops any where?
If yes, where did you find them?
On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.
9.6 ABSORPTION OF WATER BY SOIL
Do all the soils absorb water to the same
extent? Let us find out.
Activity 9.6
Take a plastic funnel. Take a filter paper
(or a piece of newspaper sheet), fold and
place it as shown in the figure. Weigh
50g of dry, powdered soil and pour it
into the funnel. Measure a certain
amount of water in a measuring cylinder
and pour it drop by drop on the soil.
You can use a dropper for this purpose.
Do not let all the water fall at one spot.

retained by the soil. Record your results
in your notebook in the following
manner:
Weight of soil = 50g
Initial volume of water in the

samples. Would you get the same results
for all the samples? Discuss the results
with your friends and answer the
following question:
• Which soil would have the highest
percolation rate?
Which soil would have the lowest
percolation rate?
• Boojho heard from his neighbourer
that 8–10 days after the rain, the level

Which type of soil retains the highest
amount of water and which retains
the least?
. Can you suggest any method to let
more rain water percolate and reach
the water underground?
9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

What you have learnt
Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.

hours. This activity is best done in the afternoon. Take care that the
soil does not spill outside the newspaper. After drying it, weigh the soil
again. The difference in the weight of the soil before and after drying
gives you the amount of moisture contained in 100 g of soil. This is
called the percentage moisture content.

Have you ever wondered why you get
muscle cramps after heavy exercise? The
cramps occur when muscle cells respire
anaerobically. The partial breakdown of
glucose produces lactic acid. The
accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle
cramps. We get relief from cramps after a
hot water bath or a massage. Can you
guess why it is so? Hot water bath or
massage improves circulation of blood.
As a result, the supply of oxygen to the
muscle cells increases. The increase in
the supply of oxygen results in the
complete breakdown of lactic acid into
carbon dioxide and water.

rate of breathing will be the slowest and
in which it will be the fastest? Assign
numbers to the pictures in the order of
increasing rate of breathing according
to your experience.
10.3 How Do WE BREATHE?
Let us now learn about the mechanism
of breathing. Normally we take in air
through our nostrils. When we inhale
air, it passes through our nostrils into
the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity,
the air reaches our lungs through the
windpipe. Lungs are present in the
chest cavity (Fig. 10.4). This cavity is
surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,
muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 10.4).
Breathing involves the movement of the
diaphragm and the rib cage.
During inhalation, ribs move up and
outwards and diaphragm moves down.
This movement increases space in our
chest cavity and air rushes into the
lungs. The lungs get filled with air.
During exhalation, ribs move down and
inwards, while diaphragm moves up to
its former position. This reduces the size
of the chest cavity and air is pushed out
of the lungs (Fig. 10.5). These
movements in our body can be felt

The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust,
pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the
nasal cavity. Then they irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we
sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-
free, clean air enters our body.
TAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign
particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.

These openings are called spiracles
(Fig. 10.9). Insects have a network of air
tubes called tracheae for gas exchange.
Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles
into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the
body tissue, and reaches every cell of
the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from
the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and
moves out through spiracles. These air
tubes or tracheae are found only in
insects and not in any other group of
animals.

plants each part can independently take
in oxygen from the air and give out
carbon dioxide. You have already learnt

have tiny pores called stomata for
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Can we survive in water? There are many
organisms which live in water. How do

You have studied in Class VI that
gills in fish help them to use oxygen
dissolved in water. Gills are projections
of the skin. You may wonder how gills
help in breathing. Gills are well supplied
with blood vessels (Fig. 10.10) for
exchange of gases.
Like all other living cells of the
plants, the root cells also need
oxygen to generate energy. Roots take
up air from the air spaces present

What you have learnt
Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms. It releases energy
from the food.
The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide
and water. Energy is released in the process.
The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellular
respiration).
If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic
respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the
respiration is called anaerobic respiration.
During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is
insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.
Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an
organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon
dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different
organisms.
During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original
state as the air moves out during exhalation.
Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.
In animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and the
process of breathing are similar to those in humans.
In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In
fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.
In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores
called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of
glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings.

Transportation in Animals
and Plants
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 11.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in plants and animals.
11.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is a liquid, which has
cells of various kinds suspended in it.
Ella
Why is the colour of
blood red?
Fig. 11.1 Circulatory system
(Arteries are shown in red colour and vein in blue)
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.
Activity 11.1
The fluid part of the blood is called
plasma.
One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin bind
with oxygen and transports it to all the
parts of the body and ultimately to all
the cells. It will be difficult to provide
oxygen efficiently to all the cells of
the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 10. So, two types of
blood vessels are present in the arteries
and veins of the body. (Fig. 11.1)
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 11.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.

I am confused! I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygen-rich blood.
2010
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart.
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.

Refer to Fig. 11.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels. On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join up to
form veins which empty into the heart.
Heart
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 11.1). Hold your
fingers inwards on your palm. That

makes your fist. Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four
chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 11.4). The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your
heart by listening through a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.

carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heartbeats. How many times did your
heartbeat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4-5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and
heartbeat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 11.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heartbeat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heartbeat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not posses any
circulatory system. The water in which
they live brings food and oxygen as it
enters their bodies. The water carries
away waste materials and carbon dioxide
as it moves out. Thus, these animals do
not need a circulatory fluid like the
blood.
Let us now learn about the remova
of waste other than carbon dioxide.
11.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells perform their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion forms the excretory system.
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578-1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called “circulator”. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harvey's idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.

contains water and salts. Boojho has
seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat.
Does sweat serve any other function?
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot, which causes cooling.

whether other animals also
urinate?

The way in which waste chemicals are
removed from the body of the animal
depends on the availability of water.
Aquatic animals like fishes, excrete cell
waste in gaseous form (ammonia)
which directly dissolves in water. Some
land animals like birds, lizards,
snakes excrete a semi-solid, white
coloured compound (uric acid). The

tube-like ureters. It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 11.6).
The kindeys, ureters, bladder and
urethra form the excretory system.
An adult human being normally
passes about 1-1.8 L of urine in 24
hours, and the urine consists of 95%
water, 2.5 % urea and 2.5% other waste
products.
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day. The sweat
Sometimes a person's kidneys may
stop working due to infection or
injury. As a result of kidney failure,
waste products start accumulating in
the blood. Such persons cannot
survive unless their blood is filtered
periodically through an artificial
kidney. This process is called dialysis.

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 11.7 (b)].

level of sugar solution. How did water
get inside the potato? For very short
distances water can move from one cell

reaches xylem vessels of the root from

Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants release
a lot of water by the process of
transpiration.
Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil. Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant. The
water evaporates through the stomata
present on the surface of the leaves by

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products to
different parts of the body for excretion.
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.
In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.
Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.
The human heart beats about 70-80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a
urinary bladder, and urethra.
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.
130
SCIENCE
Fish excrete waste substances which directly dissolve in water.
Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.
Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil.
Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the

The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the
plant is phloem.
A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata
during transpiration.
Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the
roots from the soil, to reach the stem and leaves.

lo produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms. You have already
learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
12.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? The flowers perform the function
of reproduction in plants. Flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. A
flower may have either the male part or
the female part or both male and female
parts.
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring. These are
categorised into two types: (i) asexual,
D
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds or
spores.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Sind
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.

You must have seen flower buds
developing into flowers. Apart from
flower buds, there are buds in the axil

node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 12.2). A bud consists of a
short stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are folded. The
vegetative buds can also give rise to new
plants.

nutrients are made available to them.

organism. Let us see how they

Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.

Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

SCIENCE
Activity 12.4
Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil.
The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

water. Insects visit flowers and carry
away pollen on their bodies. Some of
the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)
and (b)].

gametes (to form a zygote) is called
fertilisation (Fig. 12.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
12.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango, apple and orange. Some fruits
are hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 12.12 (a) and (b)].
12.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.
Sometimes after a walk through a forest
or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

SCIENCE
Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

Motion and Time
'n Class VI, you learnt about different
types of motions. You learnt that a
-motion could be along a straight line,
it could be circular or periodic. Can you
recall these three types of motions?
Table 13.1 gives some common
examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.

13.1 SLOW OR FAST
We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast.
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other.
Activity 13.1
Look at Fig. 13.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 13.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to
move. The distance covered by you after

It is common experience that the
motion of some objects is slow while that
of some others is fast.

direction on a road
it is easy to decide whose speed
is the highest. One who takes
shortest time to cover the
distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.
13.2 SPEED
You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
slower. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed
for one hour. In fact, it starts moving
slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of
a simple pendulum.
a constant speed or not during that
hour. The speed calculated here is
actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,
an Total distance covered
Total time taken
In everyday life we seldom find objects
| moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.
We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.
13.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME
If you did not have a clock, how would
you decide what time of the day it is?
Have you ever wondered how our elders
could tell the approximate time of the
day by just looking at shadows?
How do we measure time interval of
a month? A year?
Our ancestors noticed that many
events in nature repeat themselves after
definite intervals of time. For example,

oscillation when its bob moves

period.

cells. These clocks are called quartz
clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that
by the clocks available earlier.
Units of time and speed
The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.

There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 -1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.
MOTION AND TIME
147
Different units of time are used
depending on the need. For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from ""two thousand and one"" to ""two
thousand and ten"". The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds. This rate may be
slightly higher for children.
Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 13.5).
13.4 MEASURING SPEED
Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.
Activity 13.3
Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 13.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?
GE
Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.
The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

30 minutes till the end of the journey.
Later on she recorded her readings in

two lines perpendicular to each other
on it, as shown in Fig. 13.11. Mark the
horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as
the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical
line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point
of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is
known as the origin O. The two
quantities between which the graph is
drawn are shown along these two axes.
We show the positive values on the
x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive
values on the y-axis are shown along
OY. In this chapter we shall consider
only the positive values of quantities.
You can make the graph by following
the steps given below:
Draw two perpendicular lines to
represent the two axes and mark
them as OX and OY as in Fig. 13.11.
Decide the quantity to be shown
along the x-axis and that to be
shown along the y-axis. In this case

we show the time along the x-axis
and the distance along the y-axis.
Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm
Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, ... on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km ... on the y-axis (Fig. 13.12).
Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 13.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 13.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the
points corresponding to different
sets of values.

Generally, the choice of scales is not
as simple as in the example given above.
We may have to choose two different scales
to represent the desired quantities on the
x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to
understand this process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 13.5. The total distance covered
by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to
choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall
have to draw an axis of length 80 cm.
This is not possible on a sheet of paper.
On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1
cm would require an axis of length only
8 cm. This scale is quite convenient.
However, the graph may cover only a
small part of the graph paper. Some of
the points to be kept in mind while
choosing the most suitable scale for
drawing a graph are:
the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.
the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and
to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that we have a graph paper
of size 25 cm 25 cm. One of the scales
which meets the above conditions and
can accommodate the data of Table 13.5
could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm
Can you now draw the distance-time
graph for the motion of the bus? Is the
graph drawn by you similar to that
shown in Fig. 13.13?
Distance-time graphs provide a
variety of information about the motion
154
SCIENCE
when compared to the data presented
by a table. For example, Table 13.5 gives
information about the distance moved
by the bus only at some definite time
intervals. On the other hand, from the
distance-time graph we can find the
distance moved by the bus at any
instant of time. Suppose we want to
know how much distance the bus had
travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point
corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on
the x-axis. Suppose this point is A. Next
we draw a line perpendicular to the
x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at
point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 13.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the
y-axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How muc
is this distance in km? Can you now
help Paheli to find the distance moved
by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also
find the speed of the bus from its
distance-time graph?

What you have Learnt
The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.
Speed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the
other.
The speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time taken
to cover that distance. Its basic unit is metre per second (m/s).
Periodic events are used for the measurement of time. Periodic motion of
a pendulum has been used to make clocks and watches.
Motion of objects can be presented in pictorial form by their
distance-time graphs.
The distance-time graph for the motion of an object moving with a constant
speed is a straight line.

1. You can make your own sundial and use it to mark the time of the day at
your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an
atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle
is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of
a circular board a shown in Fig. 13.16. One way to fix the gnomon could
be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.
Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 13.16. Mark the position of the tip
of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day
as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow
every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked
by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 13.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use
this sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember that
the gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction as
shown in Fig. 13.16.

anyone sitting on it. Find its time period in the same way as you did for
the pendulum. Make sure that there are no jerks in the motion of the
swing. Ask one of your friends to sit on the swing. Push
it once and let it swing naturally. Again measure its time period.
Repeat the activity with different persons sitting on the swing. Compare
the time period of the swing measured in different cases. What
conclusions do you draw from this activity?
Did you know?
The time-keeping services in India are provided by the National Physical
Laboratory, New Delhi. The clock they use can measure time intervals
with an accuracy of one-millionth of a second. The most accurate clock
in the world has been developed by the National Institute of Standards

running for 20 million years.

available in grocery shops.) If there are
any fans in the room, switch them off.
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime. Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully. Note what happens. Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break?
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
| touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
| off due to wear and tear. This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket. This may cause overload in
| the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?

These days Miniature
circuit breakers (MCBs)

compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.
14.4 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 14.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6-10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 14.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.

pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.

What you have learnt
It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols. Using these,
an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram.
When an electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets heated. It is
the heating effect of current. This effect has many applications.
Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed through them. These materials are
used for making electric fuses which prevent fires and damage to electric
appliances.
When an electric current flows through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
A current carrying coil of an insulated wire wrapped around a piece of
iron is called an electromagnet.
Electromagnets are used in many devices.

Paheli and Boojho saw a magic trick sometime back. The magician placed
an iron box on a stand. He then called Boojho and asked him to lift the
box. Boojho could easily lift the box. Now the magician made a show of
moving his stick around the box while muttering some thing. He again
asked Boojho to lift the box. This time Boojho could not even move it. The
magician again muttered some thing and now Boojho could lift the box.
The audience, including Paheli and Boojho, were very impressed with
the show and felt that the magician had some supernatural powers.
However, after reading this chapter Paheli is wondering if the trick was
indeed some magic or some science was involved? Can you guess what
science might be involved?

The credit for the invention of the electric bulb
is usually given to Thomas Alva Edison, though
others before him had worked on it. Edison
was a remarkable man. He made some 1300
inventions including the electric bulb,
gramophone, the motion picture camera and
the carbon transmitter, which facilitated the
invention of the telephone.

You have learnt in Class VI that a
mirror changes the direction of light that
falls on it. This change of direction by a
mirror is called reflection of light. Can
you recall the activity in which you got
the light of a torch reflected from a
mirror? Let us perform a similar activity.

a straight pipe and then through

Boojho not able to see the candle
flame through a bent pipe?
This activity showed that
light travels along straight lines.
How can we change the path
of light? Do you know, what
happens when light falls on a
polished or a shiny surface?
15.2 REFLECTION OF LIGHT
One way to change the direction
of light is to let it fall on a shiny
surface. For example, a shining
stainless steel plate or a shining
steel spoon can change the
direction of light. The surface of
water can also act like a mirror
and change the path of light.

CAUTION
Handle the lighted candle with care.
It is better if this activity is performed
in the presence of a teacher or an elder
person.

mirror strip vertically on the chart paper
(Fig. 15.5). Now direct the beam of light
on the mirror from the torch with slits.
Place the torch in such a way that its
light is seen along the chart paper on
the board. Now adjust its position so
that the light from the torch strikes the
plane mirror at an angle (Fig. 15.5).
Does the mirror change the direction
of light that falls on it? Now move the
torch slightly to either side. Do you find
any change in the direction of reflected
light?
Look into the mirror along the
direction of the reflected light. Do you
Place a lighted candle in front of a
plane mirror. Try to see the flame of the
candle in the mirror. It appears as if a
similar candle is placed behind the
mirror. The candle, which appears
behind the mirror, is the image of the
candle formed by the mirror (Fig. 15.6).
The candle itself is the object.
Now move the candle to different
positions in front of the mirror. Observe
the image in each case.
Paheli wants to know, what
makes things visible to us?
Boojho thinks that objects are
visible only when light reflected
from them reaches our eyes. Do
you agree with him?
Fig. 15.6 Image of a candle in a plane mirror
176
SCIENCE
Boojho noted in his notebook: Is
it not surprising that my image is
of the same size as me whether
the mirror is small or large?
Was the image upright in each case?
Did the flame appear on top of the candle
as in the object? Such an image is called
erect. An image formed by a plane
mirror is erect and of the same size as
the object.
Now place a vertical screen behind
the mirror. Try to obtain the image of
the candle on this screen. Can you get
the image on the screen? Now place the
screen in front of the mirror. Can you
get the image on the screen now? You
will find that the image of the candle
cannot be obtained on the screen in
either case.
What about the distance of the image
from mirror? Let us perform another
activity.
Activity 15.3
Take a chess board. If a chess board is
not available, draw on a chart paper 64
(88) squares of equal size. Draw a thick
line in the middle of the paper. Fix a
plane mirror vertically on this line. Place
any small object, such as a pencil
sharpner, at the boundary of the third
square counting from the mirror
(Fig. 15.7). Note the position of the
image. Now shift the object to the
boundary of the fourth square. Again
note the position of the image. Did you
find any relation between the distance
of the image from the mirror and that of
the object in front of it?
Fig. 15.7 Locating image in a plane mirror
Paheli made a note in her notebook:
In a plane mirror the image is
formed behind the mirror. It is erect,
of the same size and is at the same
distance from the mirror as the
object is in front of it.
You will find that the image
is at the same distance behind
the mirror as the object is in front
of it. Now verify this by placing
the object anywhere on the chart
paper.

manner.
Can you now understand
why the word ‘AMBULANCE' is written
as in Fig. 15.9? When the driver of a
vehicle ahead of an ambulance looks in
her/his rear view mirror, s/he can read
‘AMBULANCE' written on it and give
way to it. It is the duty of every one of
us to allow an ambulance to pass
without blocking its way.
You might have observed that in the

images of all the objects appear smaller
than the objects themselves. Have you
ever wondered why it is so?

Now look at your image using the
inner side of the spoon. This time you
may find that your image is erect and
larger in size. If you increase the distance
of the spoon from your face, you may
see your image inverted (Fig. 15.11). You
can also compare the image of your pen
or pencil instead of your face.
15.4 PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL
MIRRORS
Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their
dinner. Boojho lifted a stainless steel
plate and saw his image in it. Oh! This
plate acts as a plane mirror. My image
is erect and is of the same size. Paheli
saw her image using the back of a steel
spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind”, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image.
Activity 15.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it. Do you see your image
in it (Fig. 15.10)? Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?
Fig. 15.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon
The curved shining surface of a
spoon acts as a mirror. The most
common example of a curved mirror is
a spherical mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 15.12).

Why are concave and convex mirrors
called spherical mirrors?
Take a rubber ball and cut a
portion of it with a knife or a hack-
saw blade (Fig. 15.13 (a)]. (Be careful.
Ask an elder person to help you in
cutting the ball). The inner surface
of the cut ball is called concave and
the outer surface is called convex
(Fig. 15.13 (b)).

The inner surface of a spoon acts like
a concave mirror, while its outer surface
acts like a convex mirror.
We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.
Activity 15.6
Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 15.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 15.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror.
Activity 15.7
CAUTION
You will conduct Activity 15.6 in the
sunlight. Be careful, never look
directly towards the sun or its image
as it may damage your eyes. You may
look at the image of the sun when it
is thrown on a screen or a wall.
Fix a concave mirror on a stand (any
arrangement to keep the mirror steady
would do) and place it on a table
(Fig. 15.15). Paste a piece of white paper
on a cardboard sheet (say about

Keep a lighted candle on the table at a
distance of about 50 cm from the mirror.
Try to obtain the image of the flame on
the screen. For this, move the screen till
a sharp image of the flame is obtained
Make sure that, the screen does not
obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror. Is this image real or
virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame?
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 15.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 15.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
(Fig. 15.17). The reflectors of torches,
headlights of cars and scooters are
concave in shape (Fig. 15.18).

Can you now recognise the mirrors
used as side mirrors in scooters? These
are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can
form images of objects spread over a large
area. So, these help the drivers to see
the traffic behind them (Fig. 15.20).
15.5 IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES
You might have seen a magnifying glass.
It is used to read very small print
(Fig. 15.21). You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a
cockroach or an earthworm. The
magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.
Lenses are widely used in spectacles,
telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.
Get some lenses. Touch and feel
them. Can you find some difference just
by touching? Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges
are convex lenses (Fig. 15.22 (a)]. Those

the paper. Hold the lens and the paper
in this position for a few minutes. Does
the paper begin to burn?
Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens. Do you see a bright spot
A convex lens converges (bends
inward) the light generally falling on it
[Fig. 15.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a
converging lens. On the other hand, a
concave lens diverges (bends outward)
the light and is called a diverging lens

We have seen in the case of mirrors
that for different positions of the object
the nature and size of the image change.
Is it true for lenses also?
Let us find out.
Activity 15.10
Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand
as you did with the concave mirror. Place
it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a
distance of about 50 cm from the lens
[Fig. 15.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image
of the candle on a paper screen placed
on the other side of the lens. You may
have to move the screen towards or away
from the lens to get a sharp image of
the flame. What kind of image did you
get? Is it real or virtual?
Now vary the distance of the candle
from the lens [Fig. 15.25 (b)]. Try to
obtain the image of the candle flame
every time on the paper screen by
moving it. Record your observations as
you did in Activity 15.7 for the concave
mirror.
It means that we can see the

are seven colours in a rainbow, though
it may not be easy to distinguish all of
them. These are — red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo and violet.
You might have seen that when you

Light travels along straight lines.
Any polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.
An image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.
An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.
The image formed by a plane mirror is erect. It is virtual and is of the
same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.
In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on the

Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 15.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an

on that day are shown in Fig. 16.1.

teachers must very often be advising you
not to waste water. No wonder we
celebrate water day every year to attract
the attention of everybody towards the
importance of conserving water.
The amount of water recommended
by the United Nations for drinking,
washing, cooking and maintaining proper
hygiene is a minimum of 50 litres per
person per day. This amount is about
two and a half buckets of water per
person per day. Is your family getting at
least this much of water? If yes, you
should consider yourself fortunate
because millions of people in our
country do not get enough water. What
about your friends and their families?
Share your experience with them.
In some places there is an acute
shortage of water. Taps running dry,
long queues for water (Fig. 16.2), fights,
marches and protests for demand of
water have become a common sight,
especially during summers. Some of the

magazines on the news items, articles
and pictures related to water shortage.
Paste them in your scrapbook and share

faced by the people and discuss them

Water shortage has become a matter
of concern throughout the world. It is
estimated that in a few years from now
more than one third of the people in
the world could face water scarcity.
Before we discuss why water is
getting scarce we must know how much
water is available for use on our planet.
16.1 HOW MUCH WATER IS AVAILABLE
Look at the picture of the earth taken
from space. Why does it appear blue?
Surely, you can guess!
You are aware that about 71% of
the earth's surface is covered with
water. Almost all the water on the
earth is contained in the seas and
oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as
groundwater and in the atmosphere.
However, most of this water is not fit for
human consumption. The water that is
fit for use is freshwater. Perform the

finding worry you? Discuss this in your
class.
16.2 FORMS OF WATER
Are you afraid that continuous use will
some day exhaust all the water available
for use? You know that water on the
earth has been maintained for millions
of years by various processes which
make the water cycle. You have studied
the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your
own words what you know about the
water cycle.
You know that when water circulates
through the water cycle it can be found
in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid
and gas—at any given time somewhere
on the earth. The solid form, snow and
ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of
the earth, snow-covered mountains and
glaciers. Liquid water is present in
oceans, lakes, rivers, and even
underground. The gaseous form is the
water vapour present in the air around
us. The continuous cycling of water
among its three forms keeps the total
amount of water on the earth constant
even when the whole world is using it.
Does it give you any relief?
Can you recall the processes involved
in water cycle? The following activity will
help you.

SCIENCE
bodies. The water is drawn from
nearby lakes, rivers, ponds or
wells. The water is supplied
through a network of pipes.
Many villages do not have such
a water supply system. There
people fetch water directly from
the sources. Often women and
children have to walk several
kilometres to fetch water
(Fig. 16.6). The children suffer
a lot. They cannot attend
school regularly since they
spend hours in fetching water.
Women have to
perform a number of
household chores. If they have
also to spend time to fetch water
it adds to their burden.
A large number of people draw water
from wells, tube wells or hand pumps.
From where do these sources get water?
16.3 GROUNDWATER AS AN IMPORTANT
SOURCE OF WATER
If we dig a hole in the ground near a
water body we may find that the soil is
moist. The moisture in the soil indicates
the presence of water underground. If
we dig deeper and deeper, we would
reach a level where all the space between
particles of soil and gaps between rocks
are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The
upper limit of this layer is called the
water table. The water table varies from
Fig. 16.6 Women fetching water
place to place, and it may even change
at a given place. The water table may be
at a depth of less than a metre or may
be several metres below the ground. The
water found below the water table is
called groundwater. What is the source
of this groundwater?
The rainwater and water from other
sources such as rivers and ponds seeps
through the soil and fills the empty
spaces and cracks deep below the
ground. The process of seeping of water
into the ground is called infiltration.
The groundwater thus gets recharged
by this process. At places the
groundwater is stored between layers of
hard rock below the water table. This is
known as an aquifer. Water in the
aquifers can be usually pumped out with
the help of tube wells or handpumps.
Have you ever been to a site where
construction work is going on? From

where do the workers get water for
construction? May be you have seen
boring being done at such sites to reach
the water table. Enquire from the people
working there how deep they have to dig.
Can we keep on drawing water from
under the ground? How will it affect the
water table?
16.4 DEPLETION OF WATER TABLE
Water drawn from under the ground gets
replenished by seepage of rainwater. The
water table does not get affected as long
as we draw as much water as is
replenished by natural processes.
However, water table may go down if the
water is not sufficiently replenished.
This may happen due to many reasons.
Increase in population, industrial and
agricultural activities are some common
factors affecting water table. Scanty
rainfall is another factor that may
deplete the water table. Yet another
factor affecting water table could be
deforestation and decrease in the
effective area for seepage of water.
Increasing population
Increasing population creates demand
for construction of houses, shops,
offices, roads and pavements. This
decreases the open areas like parks, and
playgrounds. This, in turn, decreases the
seepage of rainwater into the ground.
What could be the consequence? Recall
that a pukka floor does not allow water
to seep in easily, while in a grass lawn
water seeps through in no time.
198
SCIENCE
Moreover a huge amount of water is
required for construction work. Often
groundwater is used for this purpose.
So, on the one hand we are
consuming more groundwater, and on
the other we are allowing lesser water
to seep into the ground. This results in
depletion of water table. In fact, the
water table in some parts of many cities
has gone down to alarmingly low levels.
Increasing industries
Water is used by all the industries.
Almost everything that we use needs
water somewhere in its production
process. The number of industries is
increasing continuously. Water used by
most of the industries is drawn from the
ground.
day by day. This results in depletion of
water table.
16.5 DISTRIBUTION OF WATER
The distribution of water over the globe
is quite uneven due to a number of
factors.
Some places have good amount of
rain and are water-rich. On the other
hand, there are deserts which have
scanty rainfall.
India is a vast country and the
rainfall is not the same everywhere.
Some regions have excessive rains while
some others have very little rainfall.
Excessive rains cause floods, whereas
the absence of rains results in droughts.
Therefore, some regions in our country
may have floods while others may suffer
from droughts at the same time.
Activity 16.5
Activity 16.4
Name some industries familiar to you.
Make a list of the products obtained
from these and used in our daily life.
Discuss with your teacher and parents
how the growing industrial activity is
responsible for the depletion of water
table.
Agricultural activities
A majority of farmers in India depend
upon rains for irrigating their crops.
Irrigation systems such as canals are
there only in a few places. Even these
systems may suffer from lack of water
due to erratic rainfall. Therefore, farmers
have to use groundwater for irrigation.
Population pressure on agriculture
forces increasing use of groundwater
Given here is the rainfall map of India
(Fig. 16.8). It gives the average annual
rainfall in different regions of our country.
Locate on the map the place you live
in.
Are you blessed with sufficient
rainfall?
Is there sufficient water available in
your area throughout the year?
It may be possible that we are living
in an area where there is sufficient
rainfall yet there is shortage of water. Can
we attribute this to mismanagement of
water resources?

When the civic authorities supply water
through pipes not all of it may reach
the destination. You might have seen
water supply pipes leaking and a lot of
water gushing out of the pipes. It is
the responsibility of the civic
authorities to prevent such wastage of
precious water.
Mismanagement or wastage may
take place at the level of individuals also.
All of us, knowingly or unknowingly,
waste water while brushing teeth,
shaving, bathing, washing and during
many other activities. Leaking taps is
another source of huge water wastage.
We waste water as though we do not need
water the next time!
We have seen that most of the water
that we get as rainfall just flows away.
This is a waste of precious natural
resource. The rainwater can be used to
recharge the groundwater. This is
referred to as water harvesting or
rainwater harvesting, about which you
have learnt in Class VI.
Find out if the buildings in your
neighbourhood have water harvesting
systems installed.
We have at many places in India an
age old practice of water storage and
water recharge like the bawris. Bawri
was the traditional way of collecting
water. With time the bawris fell into
disuse and garbage started piling in these
reservoirs. However, because of the acute
water shortage, people in these areas
have had to rethink. The bawris are being
revived. Today the situation is that inspite
of scanty rains these places are
managing their water needs well.
A farmer using water in the field can
also use water economically. Maybe
you have heard of drip irrigation
(Fig. 16.9). Drip irrigation is a technique
of watering plants by making use of
narrow tubings which deliver water
directly at the base of the plant.
A case study
Bhujpur in the Kutch area of Gujarat has a very erratic rainfall. The only source
of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water
throughout the year. Over the years, demand for water has grown. The withdrawal
of groundwater has far exceeded recharge. As a result the water table has gone
down alarmingly.
In 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to
harvest rainwater. Eighteen check-dams were built on the Rukmavati river and
its many tributaries. The water so collected increased percolation through the
soil and recharged the aquifers.
According to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into
the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation.

16.7 WHAT ROLE YOU CAN PLAY
Have you ever shown concern if you saw
a tap leaking in your house, school or
any other place? Leaking taps waste a
lot of water. You must make efforts to
stop this leakage.
There are a number of ways you can
adopt to minimise the wastage of water.
Let us begin. We have given a few
examples. Add on!
16.8 EFFECT OF WATER SCARCITY ON
PLANTS
You must have seen potted plants
wilting and ultimately drying up if they
did not get water even for a few days.
You have already learnt in Chapter 1
that plants need water to get nutrients
from the soil to prepare their food. Just
imagine the consequences if water is not
available to plants!
The green character of the planet
shall be lost. This may mean the end
of all life, for a world without plants
shall mean no food, no oxygen, not
enough rain, and innumerable other
problems.
A successful initiative
Rajasthan is a hot and dry place. The challenge of natural scarcity of water was
met by a successful experiment. A band of social workers has transformed a dry
area in the Alwar district into a green place. They have revived five dried-up
rivers — Arveri, Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahazwali by constructing water-
harvesting structures.

What you have learnt
Water is essential for all living beings. There can be no life without it.
Water exists in three forms: solid, liquid and vapour.
Though water is maintained by the water cycle, yet there is an acute
scarcity of water in many parts of the globe.
There is an uneven distribution of water. Much of it has resulted from
human activities.
Rapid growth of industries, increasing population, growing irrigation
requirements and mismanagement are some of the causes for water
shortage.
We need to be worried about the wastage during the supply of water
through pipes, the leaking taps in buildings and other places.
Unnecessary use of water and overdrawing from groundwater should be
avoided. Recharge of water to the ground should be increased.
The need of the hour is that every individual uses water economically.
Plants wilt and ultimately dry-up if they are not watered for a few days.

park with an elderly person. He
introduced him to his friends.
Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in
the university. The children started
playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a
bench in the corner. He was tired as he
had participated in the golden jubilee
celebrations of the town. After a while,
the children also came and sat around
him. They wanted to know about the
celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that
after the cultural programme, the
senior people discussed the town's
unemployment problem. A plan was
proposed to put up a factory by clearing
an area of the forest just outside the
town. This would give the increasing
population of the town a chance to get
jobs. The children were very surprised
when Prof Ahmad told them that many
people had objected to this idea.
“This is because the forests serve as
green lungs and water purifying systems
in nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The
children were confused. Prof Ahmad
realised that the children had not visited
a forest. The children also wanted to

One Sunday morning, the children
packed a few things like a knife, a hand
lens, a stick, a notebook and walked
together through a forest trail near a
village. On their way, they met Tibu, a
young boy of their age group, of nearby
village, who was taking cattle for grazing
along with his aunt. He was very agile,
running here and there to keep the herd
together. When he saw the children,
Tibu also started walking along with
them, while his aunt went on a different
path. As soon as they entered the forest
Tibu raised his hand and signalled them
to keep quiet because noise could
disturb the animals living in the forest.
Tibu then took them to a place at a
height to show them the broad view of

breeze was blowing. This made children
quite fresh and happy.
While coming down, they got excited
on hearing a sudden sound of birds and
some noise from the top branches of the
trees. Tibu told them to relax since it
was a normal phenomenon here.
Because of the children's presence, some
monkeys had climbed higher up on the
trees where they disturbed the birds.
Animals often give this type of warning
call to alert other animals. Tibu also told
that many other animals like boar,
bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live
in the deeper areas of the forest
(Fig. 17.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned
children that they should not go deep
into the forest.

out that there are several other trees,
shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.
The trees were also covered with different
types of creepers and climbers. The sun
was barely visible through the leaves of
the trees, making it quite dark inside
the forest.
Activity 17.1
Observe the various things in your home
and make a list of those which are made
from material which may have been
obtained from the forest.
You might have many wooden items
on your list like plywood, fuel wood,
boxes, paper, matchsticks, and
furniture. Do you know that gum, oils,
spices, fodder for animals and medicinal
plants are also some of the products
which we get from the forest (Fig. 17.5).

Prof Ahmad asked children to look
up and observe how the branches of the
tall trees look like a roof over the other
plants in the forest. He told them that
this is called a canopy (Fig. 17.7).
Activity 17.2
Visit a forest or a park in your
neighbourhood. Observe the trees and
try to identify them. You can take the
help of some elders or books on trees.
List the characteristics of the trees that
you observe, such as the height, shape
of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also
draw the crowns of some trees.
Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees
had crowns of different types and sizes.
These had created different horizontal
layers in the forest. These are known as
understoreys (Fig. 17.7). Giant and tall
trees constituted the top layer followed
by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs
formed the lowest layer.
“Would we see similar kind of trees
in every forest?” — asked Boojho.
Prof Ahmad said, “No, due to different
climatic conditions there are variations
in the types of trees and other plants.
The types of animals also differ from
forest to forest.”

answer to this question.

Paheli asked, “There are so many
trees here. Also, there are many forest
like this. What difference will it make if
we cut some trees for a factory?”
Prof Ahmad said, “You have read
about autotrophs, heterotrophs and
saprotrophs. You have learnt how green
plants produce food. All animals,
whether herbivores or carnivores,
depend ultimately on plants for food.
Organisms which feed on plants often
get eaten by other organisms, and so
on. For example, grass is eaten by
insects, which in turn, is taken by the
frog. The frog is consumed by snakes.
This is said to form a food chain:
Grass → insects → frog → snake → eagle.
Many food chains can be found in the
forest. All food chains are linked. If any
one food chain is disturbed, it affects
other food chains. Every part of the
forest is dependent on the other parts.
If we remove one component, say trees,
all other components would be affected.”

plants release oxygen through the
process of photosynthesis. The plants
help to provide oxygen for animal

why forests are called lungs.

decaying leaves. They also saw an army
of tiny insects, millipedes, ants and
beetle on them. They were wondering
how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad
explained that apart from these animals
which are easily seen, there are several
organisms and micro-organisms that
live in the soil. Paheli wondered what
mushroom and other micro-organisms
eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed
upon the dead plant and animal tissues
and convert them into a dark coloured
substance called humus.
You have learnt about humus in
Chapter 9. In which layer of the soil
would you find humus? What is its
importance to the soil?
The micro-organisms which convert
the dead plants and animals to humus
are known as decomposers. These
micro-organisms play an important role
in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some
dead leaves and discovered under them
a layer of humus on forest floor. The
presence of humus ensures that the
nutrients of the dead plants and
animals are released into the soil. From
there, these nutrients are again absorbed
by the roots of the living plants. “What
happens if an animal dies in the forest?”
Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead
animals become food for vultures, crows,
jackals and insects.” In this way, the
nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes
waste in a forest (Fig. 17.9).
Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he

What you have learnt
We get various products from the forests surrounding us.
Forest is a system comprising various plants, animals and
micro-organisms.
In a forest, trees form the uppermost layer, followed by shrubs.
The herbs form the lowest layer of vegetation.
Different layers of vegetation provide food and shelter for animals,
birds and insects.
The various components of the forest are interdependent on one
another.
The forest keeps on growing and changing, and can regenerate.
In the forest, there is interaction between soil, water, air and
living organisms.
Forests protect the soil from erosion.
Soil helps forests to grow and regenerate.
Forests are the lifeline for the forest-dwelling communities.
Forests influence climate, water cycle and air quality.

1. The Department of Environment is to decide whether some portion of a
forest in your area could be cleared for a housing complex. Write a letter
to the department explaining your point of view as a concerned citizen.
2. Visit a forest. Here is a list of points that would make your visit more
fruitful.
(a) Make sure that you have permission to go into the forest.
(b) Make sure that you can find your way around. Get a map and go
along with some one who is familiar with the area.
(c) Keep a record of the things you see and do. Observations make
the visit interesting. Sketches and photographs are useful.
(d) You may record bird calls.
(e) Collect different kinds of seeds or hard fruits like nuts.
(f) Try to recognise various types of trees, shrubs, herbs, etc. Make
lists of plants from different places in the forest and of different
layers. You may not be able to name all the plants, but it is worth
recording and seeing where they grow. Make a record of
approximate heights of plants, crown shape, bark texture, leaf
size, and flower colour.
(g Learn to recognise the animal's droppings.
(h) Interview the forest officials and the people of surrounding vil
lages and other visitors.
You must never collect birds' eggs, and their nests should never be
disturbed.

Treatment of polluted water
Perform the following activity. It will help
you understand the processes that take
place at the wastewater treatment plant.
Activity 18.4
Divide yourself into groups to perform
the activity. Record observations at each
stage:
• Fill a large glass jar 3/4 full of water.
Add some dirty organic matter such
as grass pieces or orange peels, a
small amount of detergent, and a few
drops of an ink or any colour.
• Cap the jar, shake it well and let the
mixture stand in the sun for two
days.
After two days, shake the mixture
and pour a small sample into test
tube. Label this test tube “Before
treatment; Sample 1”. How does it
smell?
• Use an aerator from an aquarium to
bubble air through the sample in the
glass jar. Allow several hours for
aeration; leave the aerator attached
overnight. If you do not have an
aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or
a mixer. You may have to stir it
several times.
The next day when aeration is
complete, pour another sample into
a second test tube. Label it as “After
aeration; Sample 2”.
Fold a piece of filter paper to form a
cone. Wet the paper with tap water
and then insert the cone in a funnel.
Mount the funnel on a support
(as you have learnt in Class VI).
Place layers of sand, fine gravel and
finally medium gravel in the funnel
(Fig. 18.2). (An actual filtration plant
does not use filter paper, but the sand
filter is several metres deep).
Pour the remaining aerated liquid
through the filter into the beakers.
Do not allow the liquid to spill over
the filter. If the filtered liquid is not
clear, filter it a few times till you get
clear water.
· Pour a sample of the filtered water
into a third test tube labelled
“Filtered; Sample 3”.
. Pour another sample of the filtered
water into a fourth test tube. Add a
small piece of a chlorine tablet. Mix
well until the water is clear. Label the
test tube “Chlorinated; Sample 4"".
222

2. Water then goes to a grit and sand
removal tank. The speed of the
incoming wastewater is decreased to
allow sand, grit and pebbles to settle
down (Fig. 18.4).
. Observe carefully the samples in all
the test tubes. Do not taste! Just
smell them!
Now answer the following questions:
(a) What changes did you observe in the
appearance of the liquid after
aeration?
(b) Did aeration change the odour?
(c) What was removed by the sand filter?
(d) Did chlorine remove the colour?
(e) Did chlorine have an odour? Was it
worse than that of the wastewater?
18.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
(WWTP)
Treatment of wastewater involves
physical, chemical, and biological
processes, which remove physical,
chemical and biological matter that
contaminates the wastewater.
1. Wastewater is passed through bar
screens. Large objects like rags,
sticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins
are removed (Fig. 18.3).
Fig. 18.4 Grit and sand removal tank
3. The water is then allowed to settle in
a large tank which is sloped towards
the middle. Solids like faeces settle
at the bottom and are removed with
a scraper. This is the sludge. A
skimmer removes the floatable solids
like oil and grease. Water so cleared
is called clarified water (Fig. 18.5).
WASTEWATER STORY
223
The activated sludge is about 97%
water. The water is removed by sand
drying beds or machines. Dried sludge
is used as manure, returning organic
matter and nutrients to the soil.
The treated water has a very low level
of organic material and suspended
matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river
or into the ground. Nature cleans it up
further. Sometimes it may be necessary
to disinfect water with chemicals like
chlorine and ozone before releasing it
into the distribution system.
Become an active citizen
Waste generation is a natural part of
human activity. But we can limit the
type of waste and quantity of waste
produced. Often we have been repelled
by offensive smell. The sight of open
drains is disgusting. The situation
Fig. 18.5 Water clarifer
The sludge is transferred to a
separate tank where it is decomposed
by the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas
produced in the process can be used as
fuel or can be used to produce electricity.
4. Air is pumped into the clarified water
to help aerobic bacteria to grow.
Bacteria consume human waste,
food waste, soaps and other
unwanted matter still remaining in
clarified water (Fig. 18.6).
After several hours, the suspended
microbes settle at the bottom of the tank
as activated sludge. The water is then
removed from the top.
The water in a river is cleaned
naturally by processes that are
similar to those adopted in a
wastewater treatment plant.
Did you know?
It has been suggested that we should
plant eucalyptus trees all along
sewage ponds. These trees absorb all
surplus wastewater rapidly and
release pure water vapour into the
atmosphere.

human excreta is a health hazard. It
may cause water pollution and soil
pollution. Both the surface water and
groundwater get polluted. Groundwater
is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
springs and many rivers as you learnt
in Chapter 16. Thus, it becomes the
most common route for water borne
diseases. They include cholera, typhoid,
polio, meningitis, hepatitis and
dysentery.
18.8 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR
SEWAGE DISPOSAL
To improve sanitation, low cost onsite
sewage disposal systems are being
encouraged. Examples are septic tanks,
chemical toilets, composting pits. Septic
tanks are suitable for places where there
is no sewerage system, for hospitals,
isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5
houses.
Some organisations offer hygienic
on-site human waste disposal
technology. These toilets do not require
scavenging. Excreta from the toilet seat
flow through covered drains into a
biogas plant. The biogas produced is
used as a source of energy.
18.9 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES
In our country fairs are organised
periodically. A large number of people
participate in them. In the same way
railway stations, bus depots, airports,
hospitals are very busy places.
Thousands of people visit them daily.
Large amount of waste is generated
here. It must be disposed of properly
otherwise epidemics could break out.
The government has laid down
certain standards of sanitation but,
unfortunately, they are not strictly
enforced.
However, all of us can contribute in
maintaining sanitation at public places.
We should not scatter litter anywhere.
If there is no dustbin in sight, we should
carry the litter home and throw it in the
dustbin.
Bhoojo wants to know how
sewage is disposed of in an
aeroplane.

SCIENCE
Influence others with your energy, ideas
and optimism. A lot can be done if people
work together. There is great power in
collective action.
Conclusion
We all have a role to play in keeping our
environment clean and healthy. You
must realise your responsibility in
maintaining the water sources in a
healthy state. Adopting good sanitation
practices should be our way of life. As
an agent of change your individual
initiative will make a great difference.

What you have learnt
Used water is wastewater. Wastewater could be reused.
Wastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in
other human activities. This is called sewage.
Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution.
Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.
Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature
can take care of it.
Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are
not available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted.
By-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas.
Open drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organisms
which cause diseases.
We should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal of
excreta by low cost methods.

An early engineering feat: Indus valley civilisation
One of the ancient civilisations, Harappa and Mohenjodaro had perhaps
the world's first urban sanitation system. Within the city individual
houses, or groups of houses, obtained water from wells. There was a
separate room for bathing, and wastewater was directed to the covered
drains which lined the major streets. The oldest toilet made of bricks is
about 4500 years old.

"Wind, Storms And Cyclones",8,Thunderstorm and Cyclone,Thunderstorm and Cyclone,,do_312796455265476608117144_5,"8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

Wind flow pattern
What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.
The following flow chart will help you to understand the phenomena
that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

Extended Learning – Activities and Projects
1. You can perform the Activity 8.5 in the chapter slight
differently at home. Use two plastic bottles of the same size. Stretch one
balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.
2. You can make your own anemometer.
Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the
Fig. 8.18. This will give you the centres of the strips.

WINDS, STORMS AND CYCLONES
93
Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.

air rises up? As the warm air rises up,
it pushes the bag above the candle. Does
the disturbance of the balance suggest
that the warm air is lighter than the cold
air?
Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.
8.4 WIND CURRENTS ARE GENERATED
DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON
THE EARTH
These situations are:
(a) Uneven heating between
the equator and the poles
You might have learnt in Geography that
regions close to the equator get
maximum heat from the Sun. The air
in these regions gets warm. The warm
air rises, and the cooler air from the

regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.
(b) Uneven heating of land
and water
You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).
The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam', which means
‘season'.
In winter, the direction of the wind
flow gets reversed; it flows from the land
to the ocean (Fig. 8.10).

winds do for us.

I wonder why the winds shown

The winds from the oceans carry
water and bring rain. It is a part of the
water cycle.
The monsoon winds carry water
and it rains.
Clouds bring rain and give us
happiness. Farmers in our country
depend mainly on rains for their
harvests. There are many folk songs
associated with clouds and rain. Sing
and enjoy with your friends, if you know
such a song. Here is one for you.
The winds would have flown in the
north-south direction from north to
south, or from south to north. A change
in direction is however, caused by the
rotation of the earth.

SCIENCE
8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.

that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

Extended Learning – Activities and Projects
1. You can perform the Activity 8.5 in the chapter slight
differently at home. Use two plastic bottles of the same size. Stretch one
balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.
2. You can make your own anemometer.
Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

• Do you see layers of particles of

The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different
layers of the soil is called the soil profile.

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

When all the water has percolated

rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)

Soil is composed of distinct layers.
Perform the following activity to find out
how these layers are arranged.
Activity 9.2
• Do you see layers of particles of
different sizes in the glass tumbler?
· Draw a diagram showing these layers.
Are there some dead rotting leaves
or animal remains floating on water?
The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different
layers of the soil is called the soil profile.
Each layer differs in feel (texture),

We usually see the top surface of
the soil, not the layers below it. If we

the soil profile at that place. Soil profile
can also be seen while digging a well or
laying the foundation of a building. It
can also be seen at the sides of a road
on a hill or at a steep river bank.
The uppermost horizon is generally
dark in colour as it is rich in humus
and minerals. The humus makes the
This provides shelter for many living
organisms such as worms, rodents,
moles and beetles. The roots of small
plants are embedded entirely in the
topsoil.
The next layer has a lesser amount
of humus but more of minerals. This
layer is generally harder and more
compact and is called the B-horizon or

The third layer is the C-horizon,

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

9.4 PROPERTIES OF SOIL
You have listed some uses of soil. Let us
perform some activities to find the
characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

the time when you start pouring water.
When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time
again. Be careful not to let the water
spill over or run down on the outside of
the pipe while pouring. Calculate the
rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)
percolation time (min)
For example, suppose that for a
certain sample, it took 20 minutes for
200 mL to percolate. So,
on 200 mL
rate of percolation = = 10 mL/min
“ 20 min
Calculate the rate of percolation in
your soil sample. Compare your findings
with others and arrange the soil samples
in the increasing order of the rate of
percolation.
9.5 MOISTURE IN SOIL
Have you ever passed through a
farmland during a hot summer day?
Perhaps you noticed that the air above
the land is shimmering. Why is it so?
Try out this activity and find the answer.
Activity 9.5
Take a boiling tube. Put two spoonfulls
of a soil sample in it. Heat it on a flame
(Fig. 9.6) and observe it. Let us find out
what happens upon heating.
Do you see water drops any where?
If yes, where did you find them?
On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.
9.6 ABSORPTION OF WATER BY SOIL
Do all the soils absorb water to the same
extent? Let us find out.
Activity 9.6
Take a plastic funnel. Take a filter paper
(or a piece of newspaper sheet), fold and
place it as shown in the figure. Weigh
50g of dry, powdered soil and pour it
into the funnel. Measure a certain
amount of water in a measuring cylinder
and pour it drop by drop on the soil.
You can use a dropper for this purpose.
Do not let all the water fall at one spot.

Repeat this activity with different soil
samples. Would you get the same results
for all the samples? Discuss the results
with your friends and answer the
following question:
• Which soil would have the highest
percolation rate?
Which soil would have the lowest
percolation rate?
• Boojho heard from his neighbourer
that 8–10 days after the rain, the level
of water in a pond or well rises. Which
type of soil will allow water to reach
a well faster and in greater amount?
Which type of soil retains the highest
amount of water and which retains
the least?
. Can you suggest any method to let
more rain water percolate and reach
the water underground?
9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

What you have learnt
Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.

SCIENCE
Soil holds water in it, which is called soil moisture. The capacity of a soil
to hold water is important for various crops.
Clayey soil is used to make pots, toys and statues.

hours. This activity is best done in the afternoon. Take care that the
soil does not spill outside the newspaper. After drying it, weigh the soil
again. The difference in the weight of the soil before and after drying
gives you the amount of moisture contained in 100 g of soil. This is
called the percentage moisture content.

takes places in the muscle cells to fulfil
the demand of energy:
in the absence of oxygen
Glucose
(in muscle)
lactic acid + energy
Have you ever wondered why you get
muscle cramps after heavy exercise? The
cramps occur when muscle cells respire
anaerobically. The partial breakdown of
glucose produces lactic acid. The
accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle
cramps. We get relief from cramps after a
hot water bath or a massage. Can you
guess why it is so? Hot water bath or
massage improves circulation of blood.
As a result, the supply of oxygen to the
muscle cells increases. The increase in
the supply of oxygen results in the
complete breakdown of lactic acid into
carbon dioxide and water.

breathing rate slow down? Does your
body receive sufficient oxygen?

carried out by a person during a normal
day. Can you say in which activity, the
rate of breathing will be the slowest and
in which it will be the fastest? Assign
numbers to the pictures in the order of
increasing rate of breathing according
to your experience.
10.3 How Do WE BREATHE?
Let us now learn about the mechanism
of breathing. Normally we take in air
through our nostrils. When we inhale
air, it passes through our nostrils into
the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity,
the air reaches our lungs through the
windpipe. Lungs are present in the
chest cavity (Fig. 10.4). This cavity is
surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,
muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 10.4).
Breathing involves the movement of the
diaphragm and the rib cage.
During inhalation, ribs move up and
outwards and diaphragm moves down.
This movement increases space in our
chest cavity and air rushes into the
lungs. The lungs get filled with air.
During exhalation, ribs move down and
inwards, while diaphragm moves up to
its former position. This reduces the size
of the chest cavity and air is pushed out
of the lungs (Fig. 10.5). These
movements in our body can be felt

The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust,
pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the
nasal cavity. Then they irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we
sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-
free, clean air enters our body.
TAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign
particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.

These openings are called spiracles
(Fig. 10.9). Insects have a network of air
tubes called tracheae for gas exchange.
Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles
into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the
body tissue, and reaches every cell of
the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from
the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and
moves out through spiracles. These air
tubes or tracheae are found only in
insects and not in any other group of
animals.

break down glucose into carbon dioxide

plants each part can independently take
in oxygen from the air and give out
carbon dioxide. You have already learnt

have tiny pores called stomata for
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

roots, which are underground
also take in oxygen? If so, how?

Can we survive in water? There are many
organisms which live in water. How do

You have studied in Class VI that
gills in fish help them to use oxygen
dissolved in water. Gills are projections
of the skin. You may wonder how gills
help in breathing. Gills are well supplied
with blood vessels (Fig. 10.10) for
exchange of gases.
Like all other living cells of the
plants, the root cells also need
oxygen to generate energy. Roots take
up air from the air spaces present
between the soil particles (Fig. 10.11).

What you have learnt
Respiration is essential for survival of living organisms. It releases energy
from the food.
The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide
and water. Energy is released in the process.
The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellular
respiration).
If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic
respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the
respiration is called anaerobic respiration.
During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is
insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.
Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an
organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon
dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different
organisms.
During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original
state as the air moves out during exhalation.
Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.
In animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and the
process of breathing are similar to those in humans.
In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In
fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.
In a plant the roots take in air present in the soil. Leaves have tiny pores
called stomata through which they exchange gases. The breakdown of
glucose in the plant cells is similar to that in other living beings.

For us oxygen is essential, but for those organisms which do not use it,
oxygen is toxic. In fact, our white blood cells use oxygen to kill invading

SCIENCE
Transportation in Animals
and Plants
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 11.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in plants and animals.
11.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Heart

Artery
Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is a liquid, which has
cells of various kinds suspended in it.
Ella
Why is the colour of
blood red?
Fig. 11.1 Circulatory system
(Arteries are shown in red colour and vein in blue)
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.
Activity 11.1
The fluid part of the blood is called
plasma.
One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin bind
with oxygen and transports it to all the
parts of the body and ultimately to all
the cells. It will be difficult to provide
oxygen efficiently to all the cells of
the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 10. So, two types of
blood vessels are present in the arteries
and veins of the body. (Fig. 11.1)
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 11.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.

I am confused! I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygen-rich blood.
2010
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart.
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.

Refer to Fig. 11.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels. On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join up to
form veins which empty into the heart.
Heart
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 11.1). Hold your
fingers inwards on your palm. That

makes your fist. Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four
chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 11.4). The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

SCIENCE
to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your
heart by listening through a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.

carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heartbeats. How many times did your
heartbeat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4-5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and
heartbeat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 11.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heartbeat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heartbeat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not posses any
circulatory system. The water in which
they live brings food and oxygen as it
enters their bodies. The water carries
away waste materials and carbon dioxide
as it moves out. Thus, these animals do
not need a circulatory fluid like the
blood.
Let us now learn about the remova
of waste other than carbon dioxide.
11.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells perform their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion forms the excretory system.
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578-1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called “circulator”. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harvey's idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.

seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in

We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is

An adult human being normally
passes about 1-1.8 L of urine in 24

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 11.7 (b)].

Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants release
a lot of water by the process of

Plants absorb mineral nutrients and

absorbed is utilised by the plant. The

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products to
different parts of the body for excretion.
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.
In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.
Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.
The human heart beats about 70-80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a
urinary bladder, and urethra.
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.
130
SCIENCE
Fish excrete waste substances which directly dissolve in water.
Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.
Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil.
Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the
vascular tissue called xylem.
The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the
plant is phloem.
A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata
during transpiration.
Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the
roots from the soil, to reach the stem and leaves.

lo produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms. You have already
learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
12.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? The flowers perform the function
of reproduction in plants. Flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. A
flower may have either the male part or
the female part or both male and female
parts.
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring. These are
categorised into two types: (i) asexual,
D
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds or
spores.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Sind
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.

You must have seen flower buds
developing into flowers. Apart from
flower buds, there are buds in the axil
(point of attachment of the leaf at the
node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 12.2). A bud consists of a
short stem around which immature
overlapping leaves are folded. The
vegetative buds can also give rise to new
plants.
Activity 12.2

on it with the help of a magnifying glass.

soil, each bud can give rise to a new
plant.

nutrients are made available to them.
Remember that yeast is a single-celled
organism. Let us see how they
reproduce?
Activity 12.3

powder from a bakery or a chemist shop.

container with some water. Add a
spoonful of sugar and shake to dissolve
it. Keep it in the warm part of a room.
After an hour, put a drop of this liquid
on a glass slide and observe under a
microscope. What do you observe? You
may see the formation of new yeast cells
(Fig. 12.5).
Boojho wants to know if

Fig. 12.5 Reproduction in yeast by budding
Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.
REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS
135
Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

1.2. Observe the spores in the cotton-

like mesh on the bread. When spores
are released they keep floating in the
air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

Activity 12.4
Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil.
The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

water. Insects visit flowers and carry
away pollen on their bodies. Some of
the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)
and (b)].

fertilisation (Fig. 12.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
12.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango, apple and orange. Some fruits
are hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 12.12 (a) and (b)].
12.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.

or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

SCIENCE
Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.

13.1 SLOW OR FAST
We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast.
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other.
Activity 13.1
Look at Fig. 13.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 13.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to
move. The distance covered by you after

It is common experience that the
motion of some objects is slow while that
of some others is fast.
Fig. 13.1 Vehicles moving in the same
direction on a road
it is easy to decide whose speed
is the highest. One who takes
shortest time to cover the
distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.
13.2 SPEED
You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
slower. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed

slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of
a simple pendulum.
a constant speed or not during that

actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,

In everyday life we seldom find objects
| moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.
We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.
13.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME
If you did not have a clock, how would
you decide what time of the day it is?
Have you ever wondered how our elders
could tell the approximate time of the
day by just looking at shadows?
How do we measure time interval of
a month? A year?
Our ancestors noticed that many
events in nature repeat themselves after
definite intervals of time. For example,

pendulum also completes one
oscillation when its bob moves
from one extreme position A to the
other extreme position B and
comes back to A. The time taken
by the pendulum to complete one
oscillation is called its time
period.

clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that
by the clocks available earlier.
Units of time and speed
The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.

There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 -1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.
MOTION AND TIME
147
Different units of time are used
depending on the need. For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from ""two thousand and one"" to ""two
thousand and ten"". The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds. This rate may be
slightly higher for children.
Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 13.5).
13.4 MEASURING SPEED
Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.
Activity 13.3
Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 13.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?
GE
Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.
The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

While going for a school picnic, Paheli
decided to note the reading on the
odometer of the bus after every
30 minutes till the end of the journey.
Later on she recorded her readings in
Table 13.5.
Can you tell how far was the picnic
spot from the school? Can you calculate
the speed of the bus? Looking at the
Table, Boojho teased Paheli whether she
can tell how far they would have

answer to this question. They went to
their teacher. She told them that one
way to solve this problem is to plot a

such a graph is plotted.

Take a sheet of graph paper. Draw
two lines perpendicular to each other
on it, as shown in Fig. 13.11. Mark the
horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as
the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical
line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point
of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is
known as the origin O. The two
quantities between which the graph is
drawn are shown along these two axes.
We show the positive values on the
x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive
values on the y-axis are shown along
OY. In this chapter we shall consider
only the positive values of quantities.
You can make the graph by following
the steps given below:
Draw two perpendicular lines to
represent the two axes and mark
them as OX and OY as in Fig. 13.11.
Decide the quantity to be shown
along the x-axis and that to be
shown along the y-axis. In this case

we show the time along the x-axis

Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm
Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, ... on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km ... on the y-axis (Fig. 13.12).
Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 13.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 13.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the
points corresponding to different
sets of values.

Generally, the choice of scales is not
as simple as in the example given above.
We may have to choose two different scales
to represent the desired quantities on the
x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to
understand this process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 13.5. The total distance covered
by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to
choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall
have to draw an axis of length 80 cm.
This is not possible on a sheet of paper.
On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1
cm would require an axis of length only
8 cm. This scale is quite convenient.
However, the graph may cover only a
small part of the graph paper. Some of
the points to be kept in mind while
choosing the most suitable scale for
drawing a graph are:
the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.
the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and
to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that we have a graph paper
of size 25 cm 25 cm. One of the scales
which meets the above conditions and
can accommodate the data of Table 13.5
could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm
Can you now draw the distance-time
graph for the motion of the bus? Is the
graph drawn by you similar to that
shown in Fig. 13.13?
Distance-time graphs provide a
variety of information about the motion
154
SCIENCE
when compared to the data presented
by a table. For example, Table 13.5 gives
information about the distance moved
by the bus only at some definite time
intervals. On the other hand, from the
distance-time graph we can find the
distance moved by the bus at any
instant of time. Suppose we want to
know how much distance the bus had
travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point
corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on
the x-axis. Suppose this point is A. Next
we draw a line perpendicular to the
x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at
point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 13.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the
y-axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How muc
is this distance in km? Can you now
help Paheli to find the distance moved
by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also

The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.
Speed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the
other.
The speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time taken
to cover that distance. Its basic unit is metre per second (m/s).
Periodic events are used for the measurement of time. Periodic motion of
a pendulum has been used to make clocks and watches.
Motion of objects can be presented in pictorial form by their
distance-time graphs.
The distance-time graph for the motion of an object moving with a constant
speed is a straight line.

your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an
atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle
is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of
a circular board a shown in Fig. 13.16. One way to fix the gnomon could
be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.
Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 13.16. Mark the position of the tip
of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day
as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow
every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked
by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 13.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use
this sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember that
the gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction as
shown in Fig. 13.16.

steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly
used for cleaning utensils and is
available in grocery shops.) If there are
any fans in the room, switch them off.
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime. Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully. Note what happens. Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break?
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
| touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
| off due to wear and tear. This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket. This may cause overload in
| the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?

These days Miniature
circuit breakers (MCBs)
are increasingly being
used in place of fuses.
These are switches which

complete. Look for ISI

deflected. We have also seen that

compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.
14.4 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 14.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6-10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 14.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.
14.5 ELECTRIC BELL
We are quite familiar with an electric bell.
It has an electromagnet in it. Let us see
how it works.

electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire
wound on an iron piece. The coil acts

SCIENCE
as an electromagnet. An iron strip with
a hammer at one end is kept close to
the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,
pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.

It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols. Using these,
an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram.
When an electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets heated. It is
the heating effect of current. This effect has many applications.
Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed through them. These materials are
used for making electric fuses which prevent fires and damage to electric
appliances.
When an electric current flows through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
A current carrying coil of an insulated wire wrapped around a piece of
iron is called an electromagnet.

Now look at your image using the
inner side of the spoon. This time you
may find that your image is erect and
larger in size. If you increase the distance
of the spoon from your face, you may
see your image inverted (Fig. 15.11). You
can also compare the image of your pen
or pencil instead of your face.
15.4 PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL
MIRRORS
Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their
dinner. Boojho lifted a stainless steel
plate and saw his image in it. Oh! This
plate acts as a plane mirror. My image
is erect and is of the same size. Paheli
saw her image using the back of a steel
spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind”, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image.
Activity 15.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it. Do you see your image
in it (Fig. 15.10)? Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?
Fig. 15.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon
The curved shining surface of a
spoon acts as a mirror. The most
common example of a curved mirror is
a spherical mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 15.12).

Why are concave and convex mirrors
called spherical mirrors?
Take a rubber ball and cut a
portion of it with a knife or a hack-
saw blade (Fig. 15.13 (a)]. (Be careful.
Ask an elder person to help you in
cutting the ball). The inner surface
of the cut ball is called concave and
the outer surface is called convex
(Fig. 15.13 (b)).

The inner surface of a spoon acts like
a concave mirror, while its outer surface
acts like a convex mirror.
We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.
Activity 15.6
Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 15.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 15.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror.
Activity 15.7
CAUTION
You will conduct Activity 15.6 in the
sunlight. Be careful, never look
directly towards the sun or its image
as it may damage your eyes. You may
look at the image of the sun when it
is thrown on a screen or a wall.
Fix a concave mirror on a stand (any
arrangement to keep the mirror steady
would do) and place it on a table
(Fig. 15.15). Paste a piece of white paper
on a cardboard sheet (say about

Keep a lighted candle on the table at a
distance of about 50 cm from the mirror.
Try to obtain the image of the flame on
the screen. For this, move the screen till
a sharp image of the flame is obtained
Make sure that, the screen does not
obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror. Is this image real or
virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame?
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 15.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 15.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
(Fig. 15.17). The reflectors of torches,
headlights of cars and scooters are
concave in shape (Fig. 15.18).

size than the object?
Can you now recognise the mirrors
used as side mirrors in scooters? These
are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can
form images of objects spread over a large
area. So, these help the drivers to see
the traffic behind them (Fig. 15.20).
15.5 IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES
You might have seen a magnifying glass.
It is used to read very small print
(Fig. 15.21). You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a
cockroach or an earthworm. The
magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.
Lenses are widely used in spectacles,
telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.
Get some lenses. Touch and feel
them. Can you find some difference just
by touching? Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges
are convex lenses (Fig. 15.22 (a)]. Those

with a convex lens on any part of your
body.

Activity 15.9
Take a convex lens or magnifying glass.
Put it in the path of sunrays. Place a
sheet of paper as shown (Fig. 15.23).
Adjust the distance between the lens and
the paper till you get a bright spot on
the paper. Hold the lens and the paper
in this position for a few minutes. Does
the paper begin to burn?
Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens. Do you see a bright spot
A convex lens converges (bends
inward) the light generally falling on it
[Fig. 15.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a
converging lens. On the other hand, a
concave lens diverges (bends outward)
the light and is called a diverging lens
[Fig. 15.24 (b)].

you not getting a bright spot this time?
We have seen in the case of mirrors
that for different positions of the object
the nature and size of the image change.
Is it true for lenses also?
Let us find out.
Activity 15.10
Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand
as you did with the concave mirror. Place
it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a
distance of about 50 cm from the lens
[Fig. 15.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image
of the candle on a paper screen placed
on the other side of the lens. You may
have to move the screen towards or away
from the lens to get a sharp image of
the flame. What kind of image did you
get? Is it real or virtual?
Now vary the distance of the candle
from the lens [Fig. 15.25 (b)]. Try to
obtain the image of the candle flame
every time on the paper screen by
moving it. Record your observations as
you did in Activity 15.7 for the concave
mirror.
It means that we can see the

Did you get in any position of the
object an image which was erect and
magnified (Fig. 15.26). Could this image
be obtained on a screen? Is the image

is used as a magnifying glass.
In a similar fashion study the images
formed by a concave lens. You will find
that the image formed by a concave lens
is always virtual, erect and smaller in
size than the object (Fig. 15.27).

are seven colours in a rainbow, though
it may not be easy to distinguish all of
them. These are — red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo and violet.
You might have seen that when you

What you have learnt
Light travels along straight lines.
Any polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.
An image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.
An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.
The image formed by a plane mirror is erect. It is virtual and is of the
same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.
In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on the
right side in the image, and right side of the object appears to be on the
left side in the image.
A concave mirror can form a real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified.
Image formed by a convex mirror is erect, virtual and smaller in size
than the object.
A convex lens can forms real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is called
a magnifying glass.
A concave lens always forms erect, virtual and smaller image than the
object.
White light is composed of seven colours.

Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 15.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an

the attention of everybody towards the
importance of conserving water.
The amount of water recommended

Water shortage has become a matter

estimated that in a few years from now
more than one third of the people in

Before we discuss why water is

water is available for use on our planet.

Look at the picture of the earth taken
from space. Why does it appear blue?
Surely, you can guess!
You are aware that about 71% of
the earth's surface is covered with
water. Almost all the water on the
earth is contained in the seas and
oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as
groundwater and in the atmosphere.
However, most of this water is not fit for
human consumption. The water that is
fit for use is freshwater. Perform the

16.2 FORMS OF WATER
Are you afraid that continuous use will
some day exhaust all the water available
for use? You know that water on the
earth has been maintained for millions
of years by various processes which
make the water cycle. You have studied
the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your
own words what you know about the
water cycle.
You know that when water circulates
through the water cycle it can be found
in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid
and gas—at any given time somewhere
on the earth. The solid form, snow and
ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of
the earth, snow-covered mountains and
glaciers. Liquid water is present in
oceans, lakes, rivers, and even
underground. The gaseous form is the
water vapour present in the air around
us. The continuous cycling of water
among its three forms keeps the total
amount of water on the earth constant
even when the whole world is using it.
Does it give you any relief?
Can you recall the processes involved
in water cycle? The following activity will
help you.

bodies. The water is drawn from
nearby lakes, rivers, ponds or
wells. The water is supplied
through a network of pipes.
Many villages do not have such
a water supply system. There
people fetch water directly from
the sources. Often women and
children have to walk several
kilometres to fetch water
(Fig. 16.6). The children suffer
a lot. They cannot attend
school regularly since they
spend hours in fetching water.
Women have to
perform a number of
household chores. If they have
also to spend time to fetch water
it adds to their burden.
A large number of people draw water
from wells, tube wells or hand pumps.
From where do these sources get water?
16.3 GROUNDWATER AS AN IMPORTANT
SOURCE OF WATER
If we dig a hole in the ground near a
water body we may find that the soil is
moist. The moisture in the soil indicates
the presence of water underground. If
we dig deeper and deeper, we would
reach a level where all the space between
particles of soil and gaps between rocks
are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The
upper limit of this layer is called the
water table. The water table varies from

at a given place. The water table may be
at a depth of less than a metre or may
be several metres below the ground. The
water found below the water table is
called groundwater. What is the source
of this groundwater?
The rainwater and water from other
sources such as rivers and ponds seeps
through the soil and fills the empty
spaces and cracks deep below the
ground. The process of seeping of water
into the ground is called infiltration.
The groundwater thus gets recharged
by this process. At places the
groundwater is stored between layers of
hard rock below the water table. This is
known as an aquifer. Water in the
aquifers can be usually pumped out with
the help of tube wells or handpumps.

16.4 DEPLETION OF WATER TABLE
Water drawn from under the ground gets
replenished by seepage of rainwater. The
water table does not get affected as long
as we draw as much water as is
replenished by natural processes.
However, water table may go down if the
water is not sufficiently replenished.
This may happen due to many reasons.
Increase in population, industrial and
agricultural activities are some common
factors affecting water table. Scanty
rainfall is another factor that may
deplete the water table. Yet another
factor affecting water table could be

in the figure. Observe what happens.
Why is the balance of the bags
disturbed?
Does this activity indicate that warm
air rises up? As the warm air rises up,
it pushes the bag above the candle. Does
the disturbance of the balance suggest
that the warm air is lighter than the cold
air?
Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.
8.4 WIND CURRENTS ARE GENERATED
DUE TO UNEVEN HEATING ON
THE EARTH
These situations are:
(a) Uneven heating between
the equator and the poles
You might have learnt in Geography that
regions close to the equator get
maximum heat from the Sun. The air
in these regions gets warm. The warm
air rises, and the cooler air from the

regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.
(b) Uneven heating of land
and water
You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).
The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam', which means
‘season'.
In winter, the direction of the wind
flow gets reversed; it flows from the land
to the ocean (Fig. 8.10).

winds do for us.

SCIENCE
8.5 THUNDERSTORMS AND CYCLONES
Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.
Structure of a cyclone
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.
If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
• Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.
Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.
How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?

8.6 DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY
CYCLONES
Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.

that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

This process is called weathering. The

rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.

is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.
this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

rocks or grass blades from it. Now add
water drop by drop and knead the soil

that a ball (Fig. 9.4 (b)] can be made from
it, but at the same time it should not be

ball into a cylinder (Fig. 9.4 (d)]. Try to
make a ring from this cylinder (Fig. 9.4 (e)].

9.4 PROPERTIES OF SOIL
You have listed some uses of soil. Let us
perform some activities to find the
characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

the time when you start pouring water.
When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time
again. Be careful not to let the water
spill over or run down on the outside of
the pipe while pouring. Calculate the
rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)
percolation time (min)
For example, suppose that for a
certain sample, it took 20 minutes for
200 mL to percolate. So,
on 200 mL
rate of percolation = = 10 mL/min
“ 20 min
Calculate the rate of percolation in
your soil sample. Compare your findings
with others and arrange the soil samples
in the increasing order of the rate of
percolation.

What you have learnt
Air around us exerts pressure.
Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.
Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth's surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.
Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.
High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.
It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.
Self-help is the best help. Therefore it is better to plan in advance and
be ready with defence against any approaching cyclone.
The following flow chart will help you to understand the phenomena
that lead to the formation of clouds and falling of rain and creation of
storms and cyclones:

Extended Learning – Activities and Projects
1. You can perform the Activity 8.5 in the chapter slight
differently at home. Use two plastic bottles of the same size. Stretch one
balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.
2. You can make your own anemometer.
Collect the following items:
4 small paper cups (used ice cream cups), 2 strips of cardboard (20cm
long and 2cm wide), gum, stapler, a sketch pen and a sharpened pencil
with eraser at one end.
Take a scale; draw crosses on the cardboard strips as shown in the
Fig. 8.18. This will give you the centres of the strips.

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.
Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.
If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.
Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.
3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.
5. Interview eyewitness to collect the
actual experience of people affected by
a cyclone.
6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2-3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The

The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different

this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.
9.3 Soil TYPES
As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving

Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.

following formula:

Perhaps you noticed that the air above
the land is shimmering. Why is it so?
Try out this activity and find the answer.
Activity 9.5
Take a boiling tube. Put two spoonfulls
of a soil sample in it. Heat it on a flame
(Fig. 9.6) and observe it. Let us find out
what happens upon heating.
Do you see water drops any where?
If yes, where did you find them?
On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.

amount of water and which retains
the least?

the water underground?
9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

look at the sides of a recently dug ditch,
we can see the inner layers of the soil,
too. Such a view enables us to observe
the soil profile at that place. Soil profile
can also be seen while digging a well or
laying the foundation of a building. It
can also be seen at the sides of a road
on a hill or at a steep river bank.
The uppermost horizon is generally
dark in colour as it is rich in humus
and minerals. The humus makes the
This provides shelter for many living
organisms such as worms, rodents,
moles and beetles. The roots of small
plants are embedded entirely in the
topsoil.
The next layer has a lesser amount
of humus but more of minerals. This
layer is generally harder and more
compact and is called the B-horizon or
the middle layer.
The third layer is the C-horizon,
which is made up of small lumps of
rocks with cracks and crevices. Below

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.

9.7 SOIL AND CROPS
Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The
Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.
102
SCIENCE
climatic factors, as well as the
components of soil, determine the
various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

What you have learnt
Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.
104
SCIENCE
Soil holds water in it, which is called soil moisture. The capacity of a soil
to hold water is important for various crops.
Clayey soil is used to make pots, toys and statues.

2. Paheli is worried. She could see a brick kiln from her house. Bricks
were being made there. There was so much smoke coming out of the
kiln. She was told that the best quality of clay is required for making
pottery, statues and bricks. She has seen truck loads of bricks being
taken away for construction of buildings. At this rate, she fears, no soil
will be left. Are her fears justified? Discuss this problem with your
parents, teachers and other experts of your area and prepare a report.
3. Try to find out the moisture content of a soil sample. One method is
given here.
Activity: Take 100g soil. (Take help from any shopkeepers to weigh
the soil.) Place it on a newspaper in the sun and allow it to dry for two
hours. This activity is best done in the afternoon. Take care that the
soil does not spill outside the newspaper. After drying it, weigh the soil
again. The difference in the weight of the soil before and after drying
gives you the amount of moisture contained in 100 g of soil. This is
called the percentage moisture content.
Suppose your sample of soil loses 10 g on drying. Then

As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,
I want to know:
What kind of soil should be
used for making matkas and
surahis?

Collect samples of clayey, loamy and
sandy soils. Take a fistful of soil from
one of the samples. Remove any pebbles,
rocks or grass blades from it. Now add
water drop by drop and knead the soil

that a ball (Fig. 9.4 (b)] can be made from
it, but at the same time it should not be

from this soil. On a flat surface, roll this
ball into a cylinder (Fig. 9.4 (d)]. Try to
make a ring from this cylinder (Fig. 9.4 (e)].

9.4 PROPERTIES OF SOIL
You have listed some uses of soil. Let us
perform some activities to find the
characteristics of the soil.
Percolation rate of water in
soil
Boojho and Paheli marked two different
squares of 50 cm 50 cm each, one on
the floor of their house and the other
on the kutcha (unpaved) road. They filled
two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.
For this activity divide yourself into
three teams. Name the teams A, B and
C. You will be finding out how fast the
water passes down the soil. You will
need a hollow cylinder or a pipe. Ensure
that each team uses pipes of the same
diameter. Some suggestions for
obtaining such a pipe are given below:
1. If possible, get a small tin can and
cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you
can use any empty 200 mL bottle. Note

the time when you start pouring water.
When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time
again. Be careful not to let the water
spill over or run down on the outside of
the pipe while pouring. Calculate the
rate of percolation by using the
following formula:
percolation rate (mL/min) = amount of water (ml)
percolation time (min)
For example, suppose that for a
certain sample, it took 20 minutes for
200 mL to percolate. So,
on 200 mL
rate of percolation = = 10 mL/min
“ 20 min
Calculate the rate of percolation in
your soil sample. Compare your findings
with others and arrange the soil samples
in the increasing order of the rate of
percolation.
9.5 MOISTURE IN SOIL
Have you ever passed through a
farmland during a hot summer day?
Perhaps you noticed that the air above
the land is shimmering. Why is it so?
Try out this activity and find the answer.
Activity 9.5
Take a boiling tube. Put two spoonfulls
of a soil sample in it. Heat it on a flame
(Fig. 9.6) and observe it. Let us find out
what happens upon heating.
Do you see water drops any where?
If yes, where did you find them?
On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.
On a hot summer day, the vapour
coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight
and the air above the soil seems to
shimmer.
After heating the soil, take it out of
the tube. Compare it with the soil which
has not been heated. Note the difference
between the two.
9.6 ABSORPTION OF WATER BY SOIL

extent? Let us find out.

various types of vegetation and crops
that might grow in any region.
Clayey and loamy soils are both
suitable for growing cereals like wheat,
and gram. Such soils are good at
retaining water. For paddy, soils rich
in clay and organic matter and
having a good capacity to retain water
are ideal. For lentils (masoor) and other
pulses, loamy soils, which drain water
easily, are required. For cotton, sandy-
loam or loam, which drain water easily
A case study
John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
- Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada-We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
How is the soil prepared?
Dada-Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
- Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada-Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion
The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no surface
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.

What you have learnt
Soil is important for life on the earth.
Soil profile is a section through different layers of the soil, Various layers
are called horizons.
Soil is of different types: clayey, loamy and sandy.
Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest
in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.
Different types of soils are used to cultivate different types of crops. Clay
and loam are suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy. Cotton is
grown in sandy loam soil.

Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. If this process continues, a
large number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.
REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS

Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When
water and nutrients are available algae
grow and multiply rapidly by
fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 12.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

1.2. Observe the spores in the cotton-
Sporangium
like mesh on the bread. When spores
are released they keep floating in the
air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
The spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 12.8) also reproduce by
means of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
You have learnt earlier the structure of
a flower. You know that the flowers are
the reproductive parts of a plant. The
stamens are the male reproductive part
and the pistil is the female reproductive
part (Fig. 12.9).

SCIENCE
Activity 12.4
Take a mustard/china rose/petunia
flower and separate its reproductive
parts. Study the various parts of a
stamen and pistil.
The flowers which contain either
only the pistil or only the stamens are
called unisexual flowers. The flowers
which contain both stamens and pistil
are called bisexual flowers. Corn,
papaya and cucumber produce
unisexual flowers, whereas mustard,
rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
Both the male and the female unisexual
flowers may be present in the same plant
or in different plants.
Could you identify the anther and
the filament of a stamen? [Fig. 12.9 (a)].
Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. The ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in
an ovule (Fig. 12.9 (b)]. In sexual
reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

water. Insects visit flowers and carry
away pollen on their bodies. Some of
the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination. If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of another
flower of the same plant, or that of a
different plant of the same kind, it is
called cross-pollination [Fig. 12.10 (a)
and (b)].

fertilisation (Fig. 12.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
12.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango, apple and orange. Some fruits
are hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 12.12 (a) and (b)].
12.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.

or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of
drumstick and maple [Fig. 12.13 (a) and
(b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds
of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of
sunflower [Fig. 12.14 (a), (b)], get blown
off with the wind to far away places.
Some seeds are dispersed by water. These
fruits or seeds usually develop floating
ability in the form of spongy or fibrous
outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds
are dispersed by animals, especially
spiny seeds with hooks which get
attached to the bodies of animals and
are carried to distant places. Examples
are Xanthium (Fig. 12.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt
All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.
In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.
There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.
In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.
Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.
A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.
A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.
The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.
Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.
Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.
Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.
The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.
Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.
Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.
Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.
Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.

13.1 SLOW OR FAST
We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast.
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other.
Activity 13.1
Look at Fig. 13.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 13.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to
move. The distance covered by you after

it is easy to decide whose speed
is the highest. One who takes
shortest time to cover the
distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.
13.2 SPEED
You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
slower. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed
for one hour. In fact, it starts moving
slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of
a simple pendulum.
a constant speed or not during that
hour. The speed calculated here is
actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,
an Total distance covered
Total time taken
In everyday life we seldom find objects
| moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.
We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.
13.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME
If you did not have a clock, how would
you decide what time of the day it is?
Have you ever wondered how our elders
could tell the approximate time of the
day by just looking at shadows?
How do we measure time interval of
a month? A year?
Our ancestors noticed that many
events in nature repeat themselves after
definite intervals of time. For example,

cells. These clocks are called quartz
clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that
by the clocks available earlier.
Units of time and speed
The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.

There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 -1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.
MOTION AND TIME
147
Different units of time are used
depending on the need. For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from ""two thousand and one"" to ""two
thousand and ten"". The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds. This rate may be
slightly higher for children.
Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 13.5).
13.4 MEASURING SPEED
Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.
Activity 13.3
Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 13.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?
GE
Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.
The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

Measure the distance between the point
at which the ball crosses the line and
the point where it comes to rest. You
can use a scale or a measuring
tape. Let different groups repeat the
activity. Record the measurements in
Table 13.3. In each case calculate the
speed of the ball.
You may now like to compare your
speed of walking or cycling with that of
your friends. You need to know the
distance of the school from your home
or from some other point. Each one of
you can then measure the time taken
to cover that distance and calculate your

While going for a school picnic, Paheli
decided to note the reading on the
odometer of the bus after every
30 minutes till the end of the journey.
Later on she recorded her readings in

Can you tell how far was the picnic

the speed of the bus? Looking at the

Take a sheet of graph paper. Draw
two lines perpendicular to each other
on it, as shown in Fig. 13.11. Mark the
horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as
the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical
line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point
of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is
known as the origin O. The two
quantities between which the graph is
drawn are shown along these two axes.
We show the positive values on the
x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive
values on the y-axis are shown along
OY. In this chapter we shall consider
only the positive values of quantities.
You can make the graph by following
the steps given below:
Draw two perpendicular lines to
represent the two axes and mark
them as OX and OY as in Fig. 13.11.
Decide the quantity to be shown
along the x-axis and that to be
shown along the y-axis. In this case

we show the time along the x-axis

Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm
Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, ... on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km ... on the y-axis (Fig. 13.12).
Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 13.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 13.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the
points corresponding to different
sets of values.

Generally, the choice of scales is not
as simple as in the example given above.
We may have to choose two different scales
to represent the desired quantities on the
x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to
understand this process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 13.5. The total distance covered
by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to
choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall
have to draw an axis of length 80 cm.
This is not possible on a sheet of paper.
On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1
cm would require an axis of length only
8 cm. This scale is quite convenient.
However, the graph may cover only a
small part of the graph paper. Some of
the points to be kept in mind while
choosing the most suitable scale for
drawing a graph are:
the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.
the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and
to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that we have a graph paper
of size 25 cm 25 cm. One of the scales
which meets the above conditions and
can accommodate the data of Table 13.5
could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm
Can you now draw the distance-time
graph for the motion of the bus? Is the
graph drawn by you similar to that
shown in Fig. 13.13?
Distance-time graphs provide a
variety of information about the motion
154
SCIENCE
when compared to the data presented
by a table. For example, Table 13.5 gives
information about the distance moved
by the bus only at some definite time
intervals. On the other hand, from the
distance-time graph we can find the
distance moved by the bus at any
instant of time. Suppose we want to
know how much distance the bus had
travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point
corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on
the x-axis. Suppose this point is A. Next
we draw a line perpendicular to the
x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at
point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 13.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the
y-axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How muc
is this distance in km? Can you now
help Paheli to find the distance moved
by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you also
find the speed of the bus from its
distance-time graph?

What you have Learnt
The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.
Speed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the
other.
The speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time taken
to cover that distance. Its basic unit is metre per second (m/s).
Periodic events are used for the measurement of time. Periodic motion of
a pendulum has been used to make clocks and watches.
Motion of objects can be presented in pictorial form by their
distance-time graphs.
The distance-time graph for the motion of an object moving with a constant
speed is a straight line.

is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of

Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 13.16. Mark the position of the tip
of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day
as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow
every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked
by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 13.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use

Never touch a lighted electric bulb

hot and your hand may get burnt
badly. Do not experiment with the
electric supply from the mains or a

When the switch is in the ‘ON'
position, the circuit from the
positive terminal of the battery to
the negative terminal is complete.
The circuit is then said to be closed
and the current flows throughout
the circuit instantly.
When the switch is in the “OFF”
position, the circuit is incomplete.
It is said to be open. No current
flows through any part of the

An electric bulb is used for light but it also gives heat. This is not desirable. This
results in the wastage of electricity. This wastage can be reduced by using
fluorescent tube lights in place of the bulbs. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)
also reduce wastage and can be fixed in the ordinary bulb holders.

However, before buying bulbs or tubes, or CFLs, look for the ISI mark of the

Fuses of different kinds are used
for different purposes. Fig. 14.14 shows
fuses used in our houses. Fuses
shown in Fig. 14.15 are generally used
in electrical appliances.

steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly
used for cleaning utensils and is
available in grocery shops.) If there are
any fans in the room, switch them off.
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime. Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully. Note what happens. Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break?
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
| touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
| off due to wear and tear. This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket. This may cause overload in
| the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?
166
SCIENCE
These days Miniature
circuit breakers (MCBs)
are increasingly being
used in place of fuses.
These are switches which
automatically turn off
when current in a circuit
exceeds the safe limit. You
turn them on and the

complete. Look for ISI

deflected. We have also seen that

compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.
14.4 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 14.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6-10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 14.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.
14.5 ELECTRIC BELL
We are quite familiar with an electric bell.
It has an electromagnet in it. Let us see
how it works.

electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire
wound on an iron piece. The coil acts

SCIENCE
as an electromagnet. An iron strip with
a hammer at one end is kept close to
the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,
pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.

It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols. Using these,
an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram.
When an electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets heated. It is
the heating effect of current. This effect has many applications.
Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed through them. These materials are
used for making electric fuses which prevent fires and damage to electric
appliances.
When an electric current flows through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
A current carrying coil of an insulated wire wrapped around a piece of
iron is called an electromagnet.

spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind”, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your

Activity 15.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face

from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?
Fig. 15.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon
The curved shining surface of a
spoon acts as a mirror. The most
common example of a curved mirror is
a spherical mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 15.12).

obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.
Activity 15.6
Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 15.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 15.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen

Keep a lighted candle on the table at a
distance of about 50 cm from the mirror.
Try to obtain the image of the flame on
the screen. For this, move the screen till
a sharp image of the flame is obtained
Make sure that, the screen does not
obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror. Is this image real or
virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame?
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 15.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 15.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
(Fig. 15.17). The reflectors of torches,
headlights of cars and scooters are
concave in shape (Fig. 15.18).

size than the object?
Can you now recognise the mirrors
used as side mirrors in scooters? These
are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can
form images of objects spread over a large
area. So, these help the drivers to see
the traffic behind them (Fig. 15.20).
15.5 IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES
You might have seen a magnifying glass.
It is used to read very small print
(Fig. 15.21). You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a
cockroach or an earthworm. The
magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.
Lenses are widely used in spectacles,
telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.
Get some lenses. Touch and feel
them. Can you find some difference just
by touching? Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges
are convex lenses (Fig. 15.22 (a)]. Those

with a convex lens on any part of your
body.

Activity 15.9
Take a convex lens or magnifying glass.
Put it in the path of sunrays. Place a
sheet of paper as shown (Fig. 15.23).
Adjust the distance between the lens and
the paper till you get a bright spot on
the paper. Hold the lens and the paper
in this position for a few minutes. Does
the paper begin to burn?
Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens. Do you see a bright spot
A convex lens converges (bends
inward) the light generally falling on it
[Fig. 15.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a
converging lens. On the other hand, a
concave lens diverges (bends outward)
the light and is called a diverging lens
[Fig. 15.24 (b)].

you not getting a bright spot this time?
We have seen in the case of mirrors
that for different positions of the object
the nature and size of the image change.
Is it true for lenses also?
Let us find out.
Activity 15.10
Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand
as you did with the concave mirror. Place
it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a
distance of about 50 cm from the lens
[Fig. 15.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image
of the candle on a paper screen placed
on the other side of the lens. You may
have to move the screen towards or away
from the lens to get a sharp image of
the flame. What kind of image did you
get? Is it real or virtual?
Now vary the distance of the candle
from the lens [Fig. 15.25 (b)]. Try to
obtain the image of the candle flame
every time on the paper screen by
moving it. Record your observations as
you did in Activity 15.7 for the concave

that the image formed by a concave lens
is always virtual, erect and smaller in

it may not be easy to distinguish all of

What you have learnt
Light travels along straight lines.
Any polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.
An image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.
An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.
The image formed by a plane mirror is erect. It is virtual and is of the
same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.
In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on the
right side in the image, and right side of the object appears to be on the
left side in the image.
A concave mirror can form a real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified.
Image formed by a convex mirror is erect, virtual and smaller in size
than the object.
A convex lens can forms real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is called
a magnifying glass.
A concave lens always forms erect, virtual and smaller image than the
object.
White light is composed of seven colours.

Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 15.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an

the attention of everybody towards the
importance of conserving water.
The amount of water recommended

Water shortage has become a matter
of concern throughout the world. It is
estimated that in a few years from now
more than one third of the people in

Before we discuss why water is
getting scarce we must know how much
water is available for use on our planet.

Look at the picture of the earth taken
from space. Why does it appear blue?
Surely, you can guess!
You are aware that about 71% of
the earth's surface is covered with
water. Almost all the water on the
earth is contained in the seas and
oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as
groundwater and in the atmosphere.
However, most of this water is not fit for
human consumption. The water that is
fit for use is freshwater. Perform the

finding worry you? Discuss this in your

16.2 FORMS OF WATER
Are you afraid that continuous use will
some day exhaust all the water available
for use? You know that water on the
earth has been maintained for millions
of years by various processes which
make the water cycle. You have studied
the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your
own words what you know about the
water cycle.
You know that when water circulates
through the water cycle it can be found
in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid
and gas—at any given time somewhere
on the earth. The solid form, snow and
ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of
the earth, snow-covered mountains and
glaciers. Liquid water is present in
oceans, lakes, rivers, and even
underground. The gaseous form is the
water vapour present in the air around
us. The continuous cycling of water
among its three forms keeps the total
amount of water on the earth constant
even when the whole world is using it.
Does it give you any relief?
Can you recall the processes involved
in water cycle? The following activity will
help you.

SCIENCE
bodies. The water is drawn from
nearby lakes, rivers, ponds or
wells. The water is supplied
through a network of pipes.
Many villages do not have such
a water supply system. There
people fetch water directly from
the sources. Often women and
children have to walk several
kilometres to fetch water
(Fig. 16.6). The children suffer
a lot. They cannot attend
school regularly since they
spend hours in fetching water.
Women have to
perform a number of
household chores. If they have
also to spend time to fetch water
it adds to their burden.
A large number of people draw water
from wells, tube wells or hand pumps.
From where do these sources get water?
16.3 GROUNDWATER AS AN IMPORTANT
SOURCE OF WATER
If we dig a hole in the ground near a
water body we may find that the soil is
moist. The moisture in the soil indicates
the presence of water underground. If
we dig deeper and deeper, we would
reach a level where all the space between
particles of soil and gaps between rocks
are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The
upper limit of this layer is called the
water table. The water table varies from
Fig. 16.6 Women fetching water
place to place, and it may even change
at a given place. The water table may be
at a depth of less than a metre or may
be several metres below the ground. The
water found below the water table is
called groundwater. What is the source
of this groundwater?
The rainwater and water from other
sources such as rivers and ponds seeps
through the soil and fills the empty
spaces and cracks deep below the
ground. The process of seeping of water
into the ground is called infiltration.
The groundwater thus gets recharged
by this process. At places the
groundwater is stored between layers of
hard rock below the water table. This is
known as an aquifer. Water in the
aquifers can be usually pumped out with
the help of tube wells or handpumps.
Have you ever been to a site where
construction work is going on? From

where do the workers get water for
construction? May be you have seen
boring being done at such sites to reach
the water table. Enquire from the people
working there how deep they have to dig.
Can we keep on drawing water from
under the ground? How will it affect the
water table?
16.4 DEPLETION OF WATER TABLE
Water drawn from under the ground gets
replenished by seepage of rainwater. The
water table does not get affected as long
as we draw as much water as is
replenished by natural processes.
However, water table may go down if the
water is not sufficiently replenished.
This may happen due to many reasons.
Increase in population, industrial and
agricultural activities are some common
factors affecting water table. Scanty
rainfall is another factor that may
deplete the water table. Yet another
factor affecting water table could be
deforestation and decrease in the
effective area for seepage of water.
Increasing population
Increasing population creates demand
for construction of houses, shops,
offices, roads and pavements. This
decreases the open areas like parks, and
playgrounds. This, in turn, decreases the
seepage of rainwater into the ground.
What could be the consequence? Recall
that a pukka floor does not allow water
to seep in easily, while in a grass lawn
water seeps through in no time.
198
SCIENCE
Moreover a huge amount of water is
required for construction work. Often
groundwater is used for this purpose.
So, on the one hand we are
consuming more groundwater, and on
the other we are allowing lesser water
to seep into the ground. This results in
depletion of water table. In fact, the
water table in some parts of many cities
has gone down to alarmingly low levels.
Increasing industries
Water is used by all the industries.
Almost everything that we use needs
water somewhere in its production
process. The number of industries is
increasing continuously. Water used by
most of the industries is drawn from the
ground.
day by day. This results in depletion of
water table.
16.5 DISTRIBUTION OF WATER
The distribution of water over the globe
is quite uneven due to a number of
factors.
Some places have good amount of
rain and are water-rich. On the other
hand, there are deserts which have
scanty rainfall.
India is a vast country and the
rainfall is not the same everywhere.
Some regions have excessive rains while
some others have very little rainfall.
Excessive rains cause floods, whereas
the absence of rains results in droughts.
Therefore, some regions in our country
may have floods while others may suffer
from droughts at the same time.
Activity 16.5
Activity 16.4
Name some industries familiar to you.
Make a list of the products obtained
from these and used in our daily life.
Discuss with your teacher and parents
how the growing industrial activity is
responsible for the depletion of water
table.
Agricultural activities
A majority of farmers in India depend
upon rains for irrigating their crops.
Irrigation systems such as canals are
there only in a few places. Even these
systems may suffer from lack of water
due to erratic rainfall. Therefore, farmers
have to use groundwater for irrigation.
Population pressure on agriculture
forces increasing use of groundwater

provided by a well-planned pipe system.
When the civic authorities supply water
through pipes not all of it may reach
the destination. You might have seen
water supply pipes leaking and a lot of
water gushing out of the pipes. It is
the responsibility of the civic
authorities to prevent such wastage of
precious water.
Mismanagement or wastage may
take place at the level of individuals also.
All of us, knowingly or unknowingly,
waste water while brushing teeth,
shaving, bathing, washing and during
many other activities. Leaking taps is
another source of huge water wastage.
We waste water as though we do not need
water the next time!
We have seen that most of the water
that we get as rainfall just flows away.
This is a waste of precious natural
resource. The rainwater can be used to
recharge the groundwater. This is
referred to as water harvesting or
rainwater harvesting, about which you
have learnt in Class VI.
Find out if the buildings in your
neighbourhood have water harvesting
systems installed.
We have at many places in India an
age old practice of water storage and
water recharge like the bawris. Bawri
was the traditional way of collecting
water. With time the bawris fell into
disuse and garbage started piling in these
reservoirs. However, because of the acute
water shortage, people in these areas
have had to rethink. The bawris are being
revived. Today the situation is that inspite
of scanty rains these places are
managing their water needs well.
A farmer using water in the field can
also use water economically. Maybe
you have heard of drip irrigation
(Fig. 16.9). Drip irrigation is a technique
of watering plants by making use of
narrow tubings which deliver water
directly at the base of the plant.
A case study
Bhujpur in the Kutch area of Gujarat has a very erratic rainfall. The only source
of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water
throughout the year. Over the years, demand for water has grown. The withdrawal
of groundwater has far exceeded recharge. As a result the water table has gone
down alarmingly.
In 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to
harvest rainwater. Eighteen check-dams were built on the Rukmavati river and
its many tributaries. The water so collected increased percolation through the
soil and recharged the aquifers.
According to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into
the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation.

16.7 WHAT ROLE YOU CAN PLAY
Have you ever shown concern if you saw
a tap leaking in your house, school or
any other place? Leaking taps waste a
lot of water. You must make efforts to
stop this leakage.
There are a number of ways you can
adopt to minimise the wastage of water.
Let us begin. We have given a few
examples. Add on!
16.8 EFFECT OF WATER SCARCITY ON
PLANTS
You must have seen potted plants
wilting and ultimately drying up if they
did not get water even for a few days.
You have already learnt in Chapter 1
that plants need water to get nutrients
from the soil to prepare their food. Just
imagine the consequences if water is not
available to plants!
The green character of the planet
shall be lost. This may mean the end
of all life, for a world without plants
shall mean no food, no oxygen, not
enough rain, and innumerable other
problems.
A successful initiative
Rajasthan is a hot and dry place. The challenge of natural scarcity of water was
met by a successful experiment. A band of social workers has transformed a dry
area in the Alwar district into a green place. They have revived five dried-up
rivers — Arveri, Ruparel, Sarsa, Bhagani and Jahazwali by constructing water-
harvesting structures.

What you have learnt
Water is essential for all living beings. There can be no life without it.
Water exists in three forms: solid, liquid and vapour.
Though water is maintained by the water cycle, yet there is an acute
scarcity of water in many parts of the globe.
There is an uneven distribution of water. Much of it has resulted from
human activities.
Rapid growth of industries, increasing population, growing irrigation
requirements and mismanagement are some of the causes for water
shortage.
We need to be worried about the wastage during the supply of water
through pipes, the leaking taps in buildings and other places.
Unnecessary use of water and overdrawing from groundwater should be
avoided. Recharge of water to the ground should be increased.
The need of the hour is that every individual uses water economically.
Plants wilt and ultimately dry-up if they are not watered for a few days.

ne evening Boojho entered the
park with an elderly person. He
introduced him to his friends.
Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in
the university. The children started
playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a
bench in the corner. He was tired as he
had participated in the golden jubilee
celebrations of the town. After a while,
the children also came and sat around
him. They wanted to know about the
celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that
after the cultural programme, the
senior people discussed the town's
unemployment problem. A plan was
proposed to put up a factory by clearing
an area of the forest just outside the
town. This would give the increasing
population of the town a chance to get
jobs. The children were very surprised
when Prof Ahmad told them that many
people had objected to this idea.
“This is because the forests serve as
green lungs and water purifying systems
in nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The
children were confused. Prof Ahmad
realised that the children had not visited
a forest. The children also wanted to
know more about the forest, so they
decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.
17.1 VISIT TO A FOREST
One Sunday morning, the children
packed a few things like a knife, a hand
lens, a stick, a notebook and walked
together through a forest trail near a
village. On their way, they met Tibu, a
young boy of their age group, of nearby
village, who was taking cattle for grazing
along with his aunt. He was very agile,
running here and there to keep the herd
together. When he saw the children,
Tibu also started walking along with
them, while his aunt went on a different
path. As soon as they entered the forest
Tibu raised his hand and signalled them
to keep quiet because noise could
disturb the animals living in the forest.
Tibu then took them to a place at a
height to show them the broad view of
the forest. Children were surprised
because they could not see any land
(Fig. 17.1). The different treetops had
formed green cover over the land. However,
the cover was not uniformly green. The

M
environment was peaceful and a cool
breeze was blowing. This made children
quite fresh and happy.
While coming down, they got excited
on hearing a sudden sound of birds and
some noise from the top branches of the
trees. Tibu told them to relax since it
was a normal phenomenon here.
Because of the children's presence, some
monkeys had climbed higher up on the
trees where they disturbed the birds.
Animals often give this type of warning
call to alert other animals. Tibu also told
that many other animals like boar,
bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live
in the deeper areas of the forest
(Fig. 17.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned
children that they should not go deep
into the forest.
Boojho and Paheli remembered that
they have studied about forests as

The land where the children were
walking was uneven and covered with
many trees. Tibu helped them to identify
sal, teak, semal, sheesham, neem,
palash, fig, khair, amla, bamboo,
kachnar (Fig. 17.4). Prof Ahmad pointed
out that there are several other trees,
shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.
The trees were also covered with different
types of creepers and climbers. The sun
was barely visible through the leaves of
the trees, making it quite dark inside
the forest.
Activity 17.1
Observe the various things in your home
and make a list of those which are made
from material which may have been
obtained from the forest.
You might have many wooden items
on your list like plywood, fuel wood,
boxes, paper, matchsticks, and
furniture. Do you know that gum, oils,
spices, fodder for animals and medicinal
plants are also some of the products
which we get from the forest (Fig. 17.5).

Sheila wondered who would have
planted these trees. Prof Ahmad replied
that in nature trees produce enough
seeds. The forest floor provides
favourable conditions for them to
germinate and develop into seedlings

Prof Ahmad asked children to look
up and observe how the branches of the
tall trees look like a roof over the other
plants in the forest. He told them that
this is called a canopy (Fig. 17.7).
Activity 17.2
Visit a forest or a park in your
neighbourhood. Observe the trees and
try to identify them. You can take the
help of some elders or books on trees.
List the characteristics of the trees that
you observe, such as the height, shape
of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also
draw the crowns of some trees.
Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees
had crowns of different types and sizes.
These had created different horizontal
layers in the forest. These are known as
understoreys (Fig. 17.7). Giant and tall
trees constituted the top layer followed
by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs
formed the lowest layer.
“Would we see similar kind of trees
in every forest?” — asked Boojho.
Prof Ahmad said, “No, due to different
climatic conditions there are variations
in the types of trees and other plants.
The types of animals also differ from
forest to forest.”

Children picked up various seeds

was like walking over a spongy carpet!
Is the decaying matter always warm?

could perform an activity to get an
answer to this question.

Paheli asked, “There are so many
trees here. Also, there are many forest
like this. What difference will it make if
we cut some trees for a factory?”
Prof Ahmad said, “You have read
about autotrophs, heterotrophs and
saprotrophs. You have learnt how green
plants produce food. All animals,
whether herbivores or carnivores,
depend ultimately on plants for food.
Organisms which feed on plants often
get eaten by other organisms, and so
on. For example, grass is eaten by
insects, which in turn, is taken by the
frog. The frog is consumed by snakes.
This is said to form a food chain:
Grass → insects → frog → snake → eagle.
Many food chains can be found in the
forest. All food chains are linked. If any
one food chain is disturbed, it affects
other food chains. Every part of the
forest is dependent on the other parts.
If we remove one component, say trees,
all other components would be affected.”

plants release oxygen through the
process of photosynthesis. The plants
help to provide oxygen for animal
respiration. They also maintain the
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide

why forests are called lungs.

decaying leaves. They also saw an army
of tiny insects, millipedes, ants and
beetle on them. They were wondering
how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad
explained that apart from these animals
which are easily seen, there are several
organisms and micro-organisms that
live in the soil. Paheli wondered what
mushroom and other micro-organisms
eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed
upon the dead plant and animal tissues
and convert them into a dark coloured
substance called humus.
You have learnt about humus in
Chapter 9. In which layer of the soil
would you find humus? What is its
importance to the soil?
The micro-organisms which convert
the dead plants and animals to humus
are known as decomposers. These
micro-organisms play an important role
in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some
dead leaves and discovered under them
a layer of humus on forest floor. The
presence of humus ensures that the
nutrients of the dead plants and
animals are released into the soil. From
there, these nutrients are again absorbed
by the roots of the living plants. “What
happens if an animal dies in the forest?”
Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead
animals become food for vultures, crows,
jackals and insects.” In this way, the
nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes
waste in a forest (Fig. 17.9).
Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he
had not explained why forests are called
green lungs. Prof Ahmad explained that

What you have learnt
We get various products from the forests surrounding us.
Forest is a system comprising various plants, animals and
micro-organisms.
In a forest, trees form the uppermost layer, followed by shrubs.
The herbs form the lowest layer of vegetation.
Different layers of vegetation provide food and shelter for animals,
birds and insects.
The various components of the forest are interdependent on one
another.
The forest keeps on growing and changing, and can regenerate.
In the forest, there is interaction between soil, water, air and
living organisms.
Forests protect the soil from erosion.
Soil helps forests to grow and regenerate.
Forests are the lifeline for the forest-dwelling communities.
Forests influence climate, water cycle and air quality.

In India the area under forest cover is about 21% of the total area. It had
steadily been falling since independence. But people now seem to have

Make a line diagram of the sewage
route.
Walk down the street or survey the
campus to find the number of
manholes.
Follow an open drain and find out
where it ends and which living
organisms are found in and

In case you do not have a sewerage
system in your locality, find out how
sewage is being disposed off.
Treatment of polluted water
Perform the following activity. It will help
you understand the processes that take
place at the wastewater treatment plant.
Activity 18.4
Divide yourself into groups to perform
the activity. Record observations at each
stage:
• Fill a large glass jar 3/4 full of water.
Add some dirty organic matter such
as grass pieces or orange peels, a
small amount of detergent, and a few
drops of an ink or any colour.
• Cap the jar, shake it well and let the
mixture stand in the sun for two
days.
After two days, shake the mixture
and pour a small sample into test
tube. Label this test tube “Before
treatment; Sample 1”. How does it
smell?
• Use an aerator from an aquarium to
bubble air through the sample in the
glass jar. Allow several hours for
aeration; leave the aerator attached
overnight. If you do not have an
aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or
a mixer. You may have to stir it
several times.
The next day when aeration is
complete, pour another sample into
a second test tube. Label it as “After
aeration; Sample 2”.
Fold a piece of filter paper to form a
cone. Wet the paper with tap water
and then insert the cone in a funnel.
Mount the funnel on a support
(as you have learnt in Class VI).
Place layers of sand, fine gravel and
finally medium gravel in the funnel
(Fig. 18.2). (An actual filtration plant
does not use filter paper, but the sand
filter is several metres deep).
Pour the remaining aerated liquid
through the filter into the beakers.
Do not allow the liquid to spill over
the filter. If the filtered liquid is not
clear, filter it a few times till you get
clear water.
· Pour a sample of the filtered water
into a third test tube labelled
“Filtered; Sample 3”.
. Pour another sample of the filtered
water into a fourth test tube. Add a
small piece of a chlorine tablet. Mix
well until the water is clear. Label the
test tube “Chlorinated; Sample 4"".
222
SCIENCE

2. Water then goes to a grit and sand
removal tank. The speed of the
incoming wastewater is decreased to
allow sand, grit and pebbles to settle
down (Fig. 18.4).
. Observe carefully the samples in all
the test tubes. Do not taste! Just
smell them!
Now answer the following questions:
(a) What changes did you observe in the
appearance of the liquid after
aeration?
(b) Did aeration change the odour?
(c) What was removed by the sand filter?
(d) Did chlorine remove the colour?
(e) Did chlorine have an odour? Was it
worse than that of the wastewater?
18.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
(WWTP)
Treatment of wastewater involves
physical, chemical, and biological
processes, which remove physical,
chemical and biological matter that
contaminates the wastewater.
1. Wastewater is passed through bar
screens. Large objects like rags,
sticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins
are removed (Fig. 18.3).
Fig. 18.4 Grit and sand removal tank
3. The water is then allowed to settle in
a large tank which is sloped towards
the middle. Solids like faeces settle
at the bottom and are removed with
a scraper. This is the sludge. A
skimmer removes the floatable solids
like oil and grease. Water so cleared
is called clarified water (Fig. 18.5).
WASTEWATER STORY
223
The activated sludge is about 97%
water. The water is removed by sand
drying beds or machines. Dried sludge
is used as manure, returning organic
matter and nutrients to the soil.
The treated water has a very low level
of organic material and suspended
matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river
or into the ground. Nature cleans it up
further. Sometimes it may be necessary
to disinfect water with chemicals like
chlorine and ozone before releasing it
into the distribution system.
Become an active citizen
Waste generation is a natural part of
human activity. But we can limit the
type of waste and quantity of waste
produced. Often we have been repelled
by offensive smell. The sight of open
drains is disgusting. The situation
Fig. 18.5 Water clarifer
The sludge is transferred to a
separate tank where it is decomposed
by the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas
produced in the process can be used as
fuel or can be used to produce electricity.
4. Air is pumped into the clarified water
to help aerobic bacteria to grow.
Bacteria consume human waste,
food waste, soaps and other
unwanted matter still remaining in
clarified water (Fig. 18.6).
After several hours, the suspended
microbes settle at the bottom of the tank
as activated sludge. The water is then
removed from the top.
The water in a river is cleaned
naturally by processes that are
similar to those adopted in a
wastewater treatment plant.
Did you know?
It has been suggested that we should
plant eucalyptus trees all along
sewage ponds. These trees absorb all
surplus wastewater rapidly and
release pure water vapour into the
atmosphere.

PRACTICES
One of the ways to minimise or eliminate
waste and pollutants at their source is
to see what you are releasing down the
drain.
• Cooking oil and fats should not be
thrown down the drain. They can
harden and block the pipes. In an
open drain the fats clog the soil pores

water. Throw oil and fats in the

Vermi-processing toilet
A design of a toilet in which humans excreta is treated by earthworms has been
tested in India. It has been found to be a novel, low water-use toilet for safe
processing of human waste. The operation of the toilet is very simple and hygienic.
The human excreta is completely converted to vermi cakes — a resource much
needed for soil.
without sewerage facilities. Where do
they relieve themselves?
A very large fraction of our people
defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds,
on railway tracks, near fields and many
a time directly in water. Untreated
human excreta is a health hazard. It
may cause water pollution and soil
pollution. Both the surface water and
groundwater get polluted. Groundwater
is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
springs and many rivers as you learnt
in Chapter 16. Thus, it becomes the
most common route for water borne
diseases. They include cholera, typhoid,
polio, meningitis, hepatitis and
dysentery.
18.8 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR
SEWAGE DISPOSAL
To improve sanitation, low cost onsite
sewage disposal systems are being
encouraged. Examples are septic tanks,
chemical toilets, composting pits. Septic
tanks are suitable for places where there
is no sewerage system, for hospitals,
isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5
houses.
Some organisations offer hygienic
on-site human waste disposal
technology. These toilets do not require
scavenging. Excreta from the toilet seat
flow through covered drains into a
biogas plant. The biogas produced is
used as a source of energy.
18.9 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES
In our country fairs are organised
periodically. A large number of people
participate in them. In the same way
railway stations, bus depots, airports,
hospitals are very busy places.
Thousands of people visit them daily.
Large amount of waste is generated
here. It must be disposed of properly
otherwise epidemics could break out.
The government has laid down
certain standards of sanitation but,
unfortunately, they are not strictly
enforced.
However, all of us can contribute in
maintaining sanitation at public places.
We should not scatter litter anywhere.
If there is no dustbin in sight, we should
carry the litter home and throw it in the
dustbin.
Bhoojo wants to know how
sewage is disposed of in an
aeroplane.

SCIENCE
Influence others with your energy, ideas
and optimism. A lot can be done if people
work together. There is great power in
collective action.
Conclusion
We all have a role to play in keeping our
environment clean and healthy. You
must realise your responsibility in
maintaining the water sources in a
healthy state. Adopting good sanitation
practices should be our way of life. As
an agent of change your individual
initiative will make a great difference.

“No one need to wait for anyone else
to adopt a humane and enlightened
course of action.”

What you have learnt
Used water is wastewater. Wastewater could be reused.
Wastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in
other human activities. This is called sewage.
Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution.
Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.
Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature
can take care of it.
Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are
not available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted.
By-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas.
Open drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organisms
which cause diseases.
We should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal of
excreta by low cost methods.

“By providing clean water and sanitation to the poorest people on the
planet, we can reduce poverty and suffering and ensure education for all
children.”—UNICEF
An early engineering feat: Indus valley civilisation
One of the ancient civilisations, Harappa and Mohenjodaro had perhaps
the world's first urban sanitation system. Within the city individual
houses, or groups of houses, obtained water from wells. There was a
separate room for bathing, and wastewater was directed to the covered
drains which lined the major streets. The oldest toilet made of bricks is
about 4500 years old.
